254,2112,considering the authorship on the texts used in class and the consistent assertion that only sociology answers the pressing questions underlying other disciplines such as economics philosophy science etc it seemed much of the material in the course was aimed at recruitment into the field of sociology a bit dubious on the data at times also,average

263,150,the class is out of about 415 points each exam is worth 80 points and you can take an optional final that could maybe replace your lowest test grade if you do good if you do the old exams and find other old exams from other students and try to get all the right answers on those the tests heavily will reflect that read the powerpoints a lot ,average

271,239,his expectations are unrealistic if you have any other classes or if you have to work exam questions are unclear making you second guess everything you think you knew it is impossible to hear anything he says in lectures no matter where you sit making note taking impossible because you only get 1 4 of the stories ,poor

820,4007,if you pay attention in his class you could do well the only thing i and i think most other students had trouble with were the pop quizzes so just make sure you know the material because he wants specific answers for those for exams they aren t actually hard if you go through and know everything that is on the study guide overall not bad ,average
