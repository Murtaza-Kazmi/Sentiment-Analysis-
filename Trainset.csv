3253,poor,"She treats students like they're kids & is very disrespectful. If you have a question,she will just tell you to read the book. Class attendance is pointless because she basically reads the book, but every now and then she'll say something obscure that she puts on the test. Avoid at all costs. There are way better Accounting Teachers here at Mason."
2968,good,"I have graduated from UofT over a year ago, but still remember how amazing this professor is! Very inspirational and truly cares for his students! I still remember many of the things he taught me about virology!"
1138,good,"He may not use big words all the time, but he gets his point across, His exams may be hard, but he warns you a long time in advance, STUDY and go to reviews, you will be all set. Probably the best bio prof. on campus."
209,good,"Dr. Molumby was one of those professors you ether loved or hated. He was extremely caring, helpful and engaging during class. The cons were that his courses were interesting, but hard to prepare for the exams. Better then most though"
3418,good,"She's a little stress because of the class load. However, she's very very helpful if you ask for help.  She rushes sometimes because this course covers a lot of materials. She makes sure that everyone knows the material well. She's the kind of teacher who'd actually make you learned!"
1921,poor,No Comments
3310,average,"Questions from lectures, recitations, online quizzes and most importantly the chapters are all on the tests so make sure to go to recitation & lecture. I've never done so much HW & studying in my life and had to teach myself everything from the chapters.  The material isn't that difficult it just extensive and there's alot to learn. Good luck!"
4017,good,"Here is the thing about Lyons. He is a great professor. If you want to learn then take that guy. He is just rude. If you are sensitive and look for an easy A, then don't bother doing security at GMU. He runs the IT security BS. This program is very successful and all big government contractors can testify for that. Thanks to professors like Lyons,"
2401,poor,This course was hell. I was an ace in chemistry in high school and here I couldn't even compete. Tests as so hard that you can't do them without past tests. Why didn't anyone tell me that this is going to be hell&#63; I'm switching to York.
3869,good,"Full of energy and hilarious. Prof. Bauman actively engages and energizes the class throughout her lesson. Tests are not too difficult but require studying like any other test. Class attendance is not mandatory but you won't be bored if you go. Great professor and made what seemed to me a not so fun subject, much better."
948,good,"She definitely got upgraded from bologna at a young age because she goes ham! She is a beast and makes class super fun. She always smells of versace and intelligence! If you want an good class with an good teacher, takes this one. She is very helpful and really cares about what she is doing! One of the best classes ive ever taken!!!!!!!!!"
4354,good,"really great man & excellent professor. lectures can get boring, i recommend u take good notes b/c he'll tell u what parts of ch. u need to study n what parts wont be on exam. exams are pretty easy if u study. overall very interesting material/class & good professor."
532,poor,No Comments
3780,good,"Great professor! Keeps things easy and simple, although the labs are ok because they take WAY too long. Other than that, don't buy the textbook and go to class once in a while (once a month) and you'll be fine. I definitely recommend her!"
4020,good,"Here's the truth about Prof. Lyons... If you are a kid that doesn't care and you are just there... He will not help you... But if you care, and strive to do the best... He will help you every step of the way. I used to believe everyone on here about how terrible he is, but really, he's just a hardass. It's tough love imo. One of the best teachers."
3654,average,The exams are 50 question multiple choice exams. Where about 40 of the questions require you to master every component of what she teaches. She does not teach you the answers during her lectures. And there is too much information to guess which is most important.
3919,good,This way the best class I took at Maosn. Dr.Bauman has managed to take a subject I thought I hated and make it something fun and interesting. You do need to take good notes and show up to class if you want to do well
2704,poor,All I have to say is ARROGANT!! He made a huge mistake with a set of test marks and didn't even apologize... the tests have nothing to do with lectures and the lectures lack organization and clarity... this course needs to be brought into the 21st century with less stress on memorizing usuless facts and more on problem based clnical learning
639,good,"JE can't keep the class engaged. Each lecture is usually him standing in front of a projector, talking non-stop until you are a zombie. He expects his literary analyses to replicate what he has taught in lecture. He also hasn't realized that his scheduling sets unrealistic goals at the end of the semester by overlapping essays & other assignments."
4252,good,"Her lectures are extremely boring, but as long as you have the the lecture slides you can pass the lab quizzes. For the exams do her STUDY GUIDES. That is basically her whole exam. Also understand the concepts, don't just memorize them. She applies them to everyday situations for the exam questions. All in all, it's a fairly easy class."
3734,poor,Useless is the first word that comes to mind. She is unable to make a answer key for her tests so every exam has to be returned for regarding. Her knowledge is limited to the slides so don't bother asking questions. Her class does make a good nap time if you need a break in your day though
0,good,"Does a great job at explaining the material clearly, and her lectures are interesting and engaging. If you want an A in this class you have to read the book and assigned articles, as well as prepare for quizzes, she is a hard grader so you won't get away with not knowing the material on the exams. "
2843,poor,"well, personally speacking, I don't like this prof thought he is very smart."
4315,poor,"It was difficult to pay attention in class though he went over each chapter through powerpoints. He didn't start sending poweroints out via email until the 2nd quiz. If you study the vocab from each chapter, you should be fine, but don't expect that you don't have to study. Contact the TA, not Dennis."
2882,good,Really recommend this course! He's an excellent professor. 
3895,good,"Before taking the class, I dreaded having a 9am ARTH class. But it actually was the most interesting/funny class I have taken. She is so passionate and she makes the class a lot more bearable. Its an easy A if you go to class and take notes. The tests are almost verbatim from the lecture notes. Don't get the book unless you plan on missing class."
1374,good,she really is amazing... her examples make everyone understand everything... plus shes pretty cute
247,average,Very hard class if u dont have a good TA so try to get a good one. practice all old exams because he gives the EXACT same problems in exam. P.S dont practice the exams he posts on bb. try to get high scores in all lab reports and practice problem sets. wait for the genetic test as it will screw up ur grade.
1837,good,Extremely enthusiastic!!! Loves psychology and made the class very fun!! The class wan't hard either.
4322,poor,"He likes to ramble and does not know how to use technology. If you are going to take this class, be prepared for an old fashioned, listen and take notes lecture. He is very friendly, but I did not enjoy his class"
1504,poor,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! TAKE ANY OTHER TEACHER he is horrible. he make you want to kill yourself and never take math again. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS
3339,good,"This class helped me decide to major in accounting instead of Ops Mgmt! Hylton is a really good teacher, lectures and examples are crystal clear. Tests aren't a walk in the park, but they aren't impossible. Do EVERY hw before lab/study before tests and you will do fine. Shares interesting real life accounting experiences. I'm walking out with an A."
2764,poor,Possibly the worst prof I've had so far....
3372,poor,TERRIBLE TEACHER! THE ONLY REASON I PASSED THE COURSE WAS BECAUSE I HAD PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF ACCOUNTING.  ****SAVE YOURSELF****
1522,poor,No Comments
1598,good,He explains everything very clearly and helps class with problems in class.  A good teacher and an easy class
3523,good,She is a great teacher. Her power points are very helpful. She is excited to talk about biology and explains things well. Not an easy A class but do the study guides she provides you and you will be fine. She gives you everything to succeed so if you fail it is on you. She is also good one on one. Seek her help if you don't get something.
3619,good,"Fondufe is probably as good your gonna get for Cell Bio. at Mason.  Suck it up, go to class, and read the text book and you'll be fine."
1626,poor,He rambles about formulas and theories that have nothing to do with the content that's on the test. He does manage to be funny at times but there's nothing funny about not being able to do well in exams and failing the class. He isn't able to deliver concepts well. Unless you're really good at maths don't even bother taking this class.
2683,average,Simplifies everything to the point of not explaining enough.
2346,good,"Only Prof to make me repeatedly chuckle every lecture. Explains concepts fairly well, and is always passionate about the lecture content. Some may disagree, but I enjoy his humour and mannerisms. Definitely recommend for Organic Chem."
3976,good,"Great teacher, she loves the subject and will have you loving it too. She is very energetic and makes the class an awsome experience!"
278,good,He's a really interesting person to listen to although most of his information that he shares with the class are from documentaries.
952,good,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE her!!!! She's super fun and her class is always exciting! I looked foreward to her class week! She's always trying to help u pass and makes everything pretty easy to do! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  BEST TEACHER EVER!! :)
2620,average,"uh oh, the class average is high going into the exam...prepare to be destroyed"
4281,good,"Very kind and sweet guy. Really cares about his students and genuinely wants them to do well. His class is pretty easy, but he makes lectures interesting and fun. Would recommend him a hundred times over. Love him."
2515,good,Great guy
3788,average,"Boring! Attend her lectures: some of her stories appear on the exams. You never fully understand the lab concepts because you go through numerous lab exercises each day. All tests are M/C, lecture and in-class HW are very easy, and the textbook is useless. I researched the material for exams and received an A for my final grade. She gives two options for the final exam."
2628,average,She is okay..The slides collect the majoy points of each chapter and her class is basically slides reading... The book did a great job of explaining the concepts and we have to work hard!
2994,good,"An unforgettable man. Even though I got tired of learning about transcriptases, I loved coming to class, because he was just so inspirational."
2609,good,She teaches in a condensed way (can be good or bad). You can choose either between her lectures+notes or rely on the textbook 100% to succeed in the course. The exam was quite hard. I heard that she s better when she teaches upper-yr (mgt223) accounting courses.
4146,good,"A very brilliant and quite knowledgeable professor. Very sharp in his field.  This guy is absolutely hilarious at times.  In terms of grading and difficulty, I would say he is somewhat challenging, but as long as you come to class and study what he tells you to study, you should be ok."
1859,good,"I really liked this class, and the professor. She is a very nice woman, and tries to get to know as many of her students as she can. I enjoyed this class, but I didn't put in as much effort as I could have. I forgot to do a lot of the concept quizzes. Those really do help!"
2184,good,"Very interesting course, well taught."
155,poor,Easily one of the worst classes I've ever taken. He does not teach what is needed to be taught in a biology courses. We are tested on random useless facts that are found in his 200 slide powerpoints rather than information we are going to actually need for future biology classes. I highly recommend avoiding him if possible.
3770,good,"Very kind Professor, very helpful. She wants you to pass the course and offers a lot of extra credit. She supplies the class with learning guides via BB, which are EXTREMELY helpful in studying for the exams. Exams make perfect sense and are logical. Lectures are well thought out and power point presentations are a positive. Highly Recommended!!!!"
985,average,"Literally no notes given within the powerpoints besides a few subtitles on diagrams. Tests are 70% true/false, 25% matching, and 5% questions that he makes mistakes on. Useful diagrams provided during exams, but won't help that much unless you know what you are doing. Attend SI sessions, definitely helpful and it will provide study guides."
2402,poor,This course is like any other course at this horrible university.  The content is ok.. the prof presents the easiest questions from the book and then the tests have NOTHING to do with lecture/tutorial/textbook/notes!!!  What is wrong with these ****s&#63;&#63;
1497,poor,"He derives every equation, never giving any examples. Sit in on Professor Calden's classes, you'll Ace the class. His classes are unbearable."
1539,poor,Most disgusting and vile math instructor at Umass. His classes are a complete waste of time. Avoid like the plague. The worst of the worst.
2023,good,such an easy class...she is hysterical
1842,good,"Lots of energy and demanding, but a good introduction to the subject."
3990,good,"This is a confusing class.  He lectures a lot and all of the midterm questions are created from his lecture/videos so pay attention.  First half to midterm is fairly easy.  There is one major group project that lasts the whole semester you will have to be creative, however the requirements are rather ambiguous.  Participate as best you can."
2552,good,he's so cool. He says so many funny things and he likes the material.
2097,poor,"Textbooks are very difficult to understand. Uses his own textbook of course and replaces them very frequently. Perhaps, consideration to students' finance as opposed to his own would make him more popular among students. Tests are VERY difficult. More problematic, don't think he's the one that actually write them."
3277,poor,Do not take this professor! Believe me. She is the worst prof. I ever had in my life. She is not helpful at all and too hyper to focus on what she is supposed to do. My GPA is 3.37 and I had to withdraw so that my GPA would not be affected.
2985,good,best prof ever ! he actually did change my life ;; he motivated students a lot to achieve their best :]
4367,poor,Took him as a freshman. Hated the class! Boring lengthy lectures. Too much reading! I would take someone else. Earned a B
700,good,"You either love her or you hate her. I personally love her, this is the 2nd class I'm taking with her and I'll take another if I can. She's crazy and funny, her classes are usually never a bore. She's a little disorganized but her class is an easy A as long as you do the work and go to class. Unlimited paper, presentation, 2 exams (15%) & journals."
1461,poor,"Not a very helpful professor and kind of confusing.  I had a great SI teacher though and managed to do very well in the class.  Just read the text book and if you are lost there are plenty of tutors to help.  Probably the hardest calc, calc III was pretty easy."
644,good,Extremely hard! but he was helpful and answered every question and email.
1807,good,"Professor Whitebourne is an very enthusiastic professor and she incorperated many fun activities. She is easily my favorite professor this semester, unfortunatly I did not put in much effort. But I would say that this class is very easy and very informative. It made me decide that I wanted a major in psychology"
929,good,Professor Christopher is an excellent teacher. Anyone that is majoring in Criminology needs to take her at least once. She is very personable and she knows her Crim!!
3235,poor,"I had Harley before, so I was scared to take her, but she wasn't that bad. She is really rude so I didn't learn anything from her. Do EVERYTHING on connect and the textbook, she does put similar questions on the test. I got a D with Harley and a B with her"
2177,good,"Great webpage. Used more slides in lecture after students requested he do so. Other than main textbook the clicker/softcover and workbook not necessary. The $190.00 price could be reduced by not incorporating these. Prof. has socialist bias, very left wing. Huge amount of reading. Multiple choice and essay que. on test very difficult. Ave. mark = C"
2865,average,"invites you to asks questions , then insults you in front of the class."
246,good,Molumby is charismatic and easy to follow in lecture.  He is passionate about biology.  He's also willing to answer your questions (although try to catch him in person--he's not great with email).    MEMORIZE THE POWERPOINTS (I used flashcards) and look at the book and lab manual.  Turn in detailed lab reports.  GO TO LECTURE.
2183,average,He wrote the textbooks we're using and one of them is just articles... which we rarely discuss in class.
923,average,"Interesting subject and love the class. Seems very opinionated and loves to share them everywhere. That's cool. Would have been better but we were forced to buy HER book for around $50+ for class, but honestly, it has very little need being there and just seems more like self promotion. Also have to tear out pages from it - so no selling it back."
3115,good,"He's a decent teacher, but as a person, HE SCARES ME."
1185,good,"Wow, good bio teacher. Knows his audience, delivers his subject wonderfully. Tries to make things as clear as possible, is always at office hours and has weekly review sessions. My class gave him a standing ovation."
4087,poor,"Lyons is by far the worst professor at GMU. Our University should be embarrased to even have somebody like him representing this school.  He is very rude, disrespectful, and when you ask for help he makes you feel like you have half of a brain.  NOT the qualities of a good professor.  I would highly recommend that GMU replaces him IMMEDIATELY!!!"
669,poor,No Comments
2130,good,Very hard class. Couldn't figure out what 25% of 1000 was!  Inequality is fascinating. Can't get enough of tax redistribution and inequality. Sociology rocks!!!! I died laughing when he &quot;accidentally&quot; said scam instead of tax!
1666,poor,"Cook would be better off as a 1950's stand up comedian than a math prof. he doesnt explain ANYTHING and his &quot;examples&quot; in class are nothing like the ones on the exams. As far as technology goes, he has no idea what a computer is, and will constantly refer to it as &quot;the machine.&quot; Thank god i took calc in high school, or else i wouldve prob failed"
2312,poor,the course could have been more interesting if the prof wasn't boring.
1421,good,"Amazing teacher, by far the best I've ever had.  She single handedly made me want to be a Psych major."
3233,poor,"If you read the book before lecture, her lecture can help you understand the general gist of the text but not how to actually do anything. As said, she doesn't answer questions and her exams are wayyy harder than necessary. I read the book and took every quiz on connects website and still didn't pass. Puts things on the exam she said she wouldn't."
2321,good,"Great course, interesting and an easy A+"
648,good,"Mr. Everett is a nice guy and very helpful if you ask for help. You can tell he is passionate about Brit Lit. His lectures can be a bit boring, but he can be funny at times. His tests aren't too bad if you study, but he does require a short essay to be written WHILE IN CLASS. He does provide a review sheet, though."
543,good,"Nancy isn't a bad teacher at all.  She's a little vague sometimes and kind of a rough grader on essays, but her quizzes actually make getting a decent grade a little easier."
1904,good,"Easy class, but hard to get the motivation to go, because the class is simply a reiteration of the book."
1512,poor,"Um...writes more notes than my English teachers do. Sometimes makes mistakes in the examples, and gets everyone confused. In at least 90% of my classes that I attended, about 50 people have just walked out. He rarely uses the book, but I suggest you follow it like no other, because it's your only hope. OWLs- Do well on them and you're golden."
2876,poor,Good professor.
259,average,"Class was way too hard for what it was.  Tests were comprised of 40 fun-fact questions, making it impossible to study for.  Would rather have learned about organelle biology that more directly relates to us.  That being said, he's a very cool teacher/ guy/ dude.  And makes it entertaining during lectures.  Still too hard though."
3722,good,"Really good teacher, you can tell she knows what she's talking about and enjoys teaching. EVERYTHING you need to know about her class is in the syllabus. Just make sure to do the MES assignments and show up to lab. The tests are fairly easy, all the information is either in her powerpoints or in definitions from the lab book."
2309,average,"cocky, repetitive (lectures=readings), testing method is absurd"
927,good,"SHE IS good! I loved her! She was really helpful and looked out for the class. Just make sure you show up and do what she says and take her notes and you will be good! Oh, she is kinda all over the place. But she is still funny af!"
612,good,"This class is really pretty simple.  The exams are take-home and are pretty easy.  He has high expectations for the essays but gives you all the tools you need to do well.  You get to turn one of your regular essays into the research paper, which makes that big project so much easier at the end of term.  Do what he asks and you will do well!  "
1023,average,"Very funny and inspirational guy. I recommend voice taping his lectures because there is no other way to review info that you need to know. Do not bother buying textbook. Tough truefalse exams. Quizzes every week (sometimes open note). Says ""it could be A or B"" in class and expects students to choose between the two on exams. Lots of grey areas..."
3526,good,"Great teacher. Slides in class come straight from the book. Has a few easy pop quizzes so come to class. Class can get a little dull, but she was very passionate and always full of energy. Read the book and got a 97 on almost every exam. She adds ~4 points to every exam as a curve. Fantastic teacher. Would absolutely recommend."
1152,good,he is now officially my favorite teacher of all time!  He makes you think and use what you've learned in order to come up with conclusions.  He is far more than a teacher that says here memorize this.  I love Prof. Phillis....I wish I didn't have to leave his class!!
219,average,"Smart guy but you gotta follow the flow of his conversations to keep up. Really nice and helpful but don't expect him to be your babysitter. Kinda hot too...this guy can really pull off a mild, scruffy, bearded look."
3795,good,Nice teacher. Way to easy. Review notes and old exams you will be fine. Don't buy the book and never attend class. Go to labs ...
485,good,"Absolutely LOVE him! Class attendance is mandatory, but he gives chances at extra credit! His tests are straight from the study guide, maybe one or two questions from the book. He is easy if you just pay attention!"
3046,poor,"Honestly, Dr. Moylan is the worst teacher to ever step on my high school campus. His snobby and arrogant attitude, accompanied with his unwillingness to help his own students, creates an aura of negative tension throughout the class. His tendency to purposely fail anyone whenever possible is due to his anemic attitude of thinking he was successful."
1783,poor,No Comments
258,good,"I was not sure what to study for the first exam, but after taking it, it is best to study his powerpoints and pay attention during lectures. It may seem like he is saying random things, but if you really listen you can see why he is telling this. Labs were very helpful in understanding lecture as well. Powerpoints best thing to study, I got an A."
3427,average,"lectures are boring.depend on yourself to read slides and book cause she won't stop and go over it.she's the only 203 teacher if you don't go to her lecture, i highly suggest that you don't miss lab. use the book, hw, and study guides to your advantage. she'll call you out if you leave lecture early"
386,good,"Molumby is a funny guy, he can be an ass sometimes when it comes to labs, but overall hes good. Exams are basically the same as his practice exams. Not an easy class!"
847,poor,"the worst teacher ever, who cares about how the formulas were developed.. TEACH US HOW TO USE THEM! dont take this class if you cant teach yourself some pretty difficult math"
3052,average,"The class is too much work. You do learn a lot though and in the end it is worth it. I liked it. This must be taken with a grain of salt because I also enjoy dressing up in latex and being whipped. He is not a bad lecturer. Unfortunately he does not lecture on everything you need to know to complete the lab reports, the rationale being that you nee"
2015,good,"professor goodenough is one of my favorite teachers of the year. she is easily approachable and the course material is fairly easy to learn. if you don't do well on tests, there is an optional research paper at the end of the class, which everybody seemed to get an A on. if you go to class, and study, you will do well."
2585,poor,"terrible, absolutely horrendous. I don't know why UofT lets her teach, shes useless and her voice is annoying. i hope she reads some of the comments that have posted on this website. I feel sorry for those who are going through hell with this woman, I know I barely survived!!"
3400,good,I am not an accounting major but Hylton was my favorite professor at mason. She was very straight forward and while the tests were hard she pointed us in the right direction. Did a great review session too.
4226,average,"For some reason, she made the exams so hard, that its hard for foreign students to get A or B. You have to give up on all your other class to get A or B. The question in the exam are too long, no time to fish all the question. I don't know its her making the exam or the crazy lab PHDs, wants us to be at their level."
1962,good,"She is one of the greatest professors. You can easily pass without showing up, but going to class is actually fun. Lots of good laughs in there. Great as a Gen Ed especially if you take it with a couple friends"
1233,good,No Comments
1747,poor,No Comments
4077,good,"Please don't judge this professor your first week of class, he appears to be a mean person but he is not. Just relax and learn, his is entertaining and you will learn A LOT! His homeworks are due 2 weeks after they are assigned. Gives study guides which are very helpful. Slides helped me study for the test than the book."
3367,poor,"She is the worst teacher in the world. She doesn't any knowledge specially computer. Don't take with her Acc301, 361. You will get an F."
3028,good,Wow I am amazed by him!  He makes me want to become a virologist and he's sooooo hot!
3196,poor,"Hylton is the worst teacher I have ever taken. She does not understand any of the material for Accounting Information Systems. She gives tests not related to her study guides. If you have to take it with her, find a friend or two in Kitching's class, and you might make it through. May your respective God(s) have mercy on you."
1095,good,Great Professor!  He challenges his students to think in ways we are not used to.  This will definitely help us in the future biology classes.
3463,good,"Enthusiastic. She uses her entire body and every ounce of energy to explain the littlest things. She really cares about her students. She drops the lowest test grade, loves her job, assigns online homework, and gives out study guides for her exams. Attendance is not mandatory."
1991,good,"AMAZING teacher! I cannot stress this enough. I was a &quot;go to class when i could&quot; type of student... but i, legit, wanted/went to everyone of Professor Goodenough's classes, as did everyone else in mahar. I without a doubt suggest this class. If you want a less stressful, education, and extremely humorous class... DEFINITELY take this one."
1320,good,"Tammy was the coolest teacher by far. This class was one of my favorite, she made the material interesting. Tests and online quizzes are easy. If you don't get an A its your fault. Highly recommend this class."
3128,poor,No Comments
507,good,... never had a better prof...
7,good,"Dr. Hora is an excellent professor who truly cares about politics and students.  Definitely expects hard work and tests can be difficult but grades fairly and the classes aren't a problem if you study.  Class participation is a must.  If you are interested in politics, you'll enjoy her classes. If not, I'd save your GPA the trouble."
3701,average,No. Just no.
2414,good,available for extra help after classes and willing to clarify in class questions with utmost attention and detail. treats students as equals.
3959,good,"She's a really nice professor, and the class is easy too. (this is 100 level) I want to recommend her."
2473,good,amazing guy..aslays their when u need him and is always very helpful....computer dummy...but hes really really cool
3695,average,"Probably the most pointless class I've taken. Easy A, but didn't learn anything. The book for lecture wasn't even cracked open. Must by the lab manual! She does Tophat questions periodically, sometimes in the beginning or lecture, or towards the end. She also does in-class activities throughout and you only have do to do 4 of them. It's an easy A"
1450,poor,"If you have taken calculus in high school and register for this class you will be all set. Extremely boring class, didn't buy the textbook, went to class once a week, passed with an A. Buy the online version of the book and you will be all set. But if you need to actually learn from him, choose another teacher."
2607,poor,"Horrible prof.  At first, seemed very nice and classes seemed easy, but then the test were horribly hard and grading unfair.  At first I wanted to be an accountant, but then decided not to because of her.  Worst prof ever."
378,good,"Dr. Molumbys exams always bewildered me but, one thing is for sure the guy raised my interest in biology. He was a really great lecturer, I missed like one class and I regret doing that because he always had something cool to say. Nice guy Hard class. Take him if you are interested in the subject if not chose a diff class."
3892,good,"This class was so much better than what I was expecting. Professor Bauman is so passionate and engaging that the information is easy to learn because she makes it fun to learn. No textbook needed which is great, but make sure you come to class because she doesn't post the slides. Take good notes and study and you'll get an A."
678,good,Everette's easy but he's got this thing where he wants you to believe what ever he believes. He gets fustrated when you analyze a piece of work differently from how he analyzes it. Over all he's easy.. just picky at times.
773,good,"He really gets the material across well and is very invested in helping you learn.  If you don't get something, he'll teach it until you get it.  He's also really entertaining for an old dude as well."
1703,average,"He jumps into examples and never tells us how he got there. some things he teaches in class arent in the book so theres no way to study some of it, and before the final he tries to teach us new stuff whispering all throughout (cold) and there was 2 pages of that on the exam. i am premed, and because of his work, i am now at a major disadvantage."
1011,average,"He teaches you how things work when they are wrong, but doesn't explain how things work when it works correctly. Doesn't mesh well with my style, however the SI sessions were the only reason I passed the class!"
1966,good,"dont buy the $100+ book (buy $10 notes) Like others have said, you have VERY little Homework, and TONS of extra credit. There are 4 tests in a semester. She drops the lowest of the FIRST THREE will not drop the 4th. Optional final AND research paper if you aren't doing too well (they only help)Sometimes she gives you extra credit for showing up"
1777,poor,"Please retire...you waste our time. Unclear, inconsiderate, unprepared, and lazy"
4245,good,"Course content was interesting.  She should find a way to create tests that can be handed back to the students for a better learning experience.  Although, a passing grade is all you need if you do well on all the quizes and hw.  Difficult&#63; No, Easy A with some work (30 min before ea class), yes."
65,good,Just want to give this guy and the Stanford everywhere program a big shout out. Thank you so much.
3588,poor,She is an okay teacher but if you have any trouble understanding accents do NOT take her. She has a very thick accent which is hard to understand while she speaks. I don't go to class because I can't understand her!
3633,good,"She has a lot of energy and tries to make it interesting.  I had her for lab, and thought she was great."
3503,good,Lectures were a bit funny. You need to buy the code to do the weekly masteringbiology assignments. She gives free response study guides for each chapter. There are a total of three multiple choice exams. I had this professor for both lectures and lab. If you do your work correctly and turn it in on time then you'll get the points.
2164,good,Take this course! The best Prof.
679,good,"Easy Easy teacher. Taught the same stuff from high school. Funny, easy going, reasonable, understanding. Rumor has it he's the easiest english teacher at CTC."
2302,good,He did NOT lecture from the book. Those who say he did must have got F.
2227,average,"like his lectures, hate his pride and stubborness, sociology man! show some mercy! unless you're a hypocrite."
781,poor,"im pretty sure thurlow doesnt know how to even use a computer. yes im bad at math, however going to class doesnt help and neither does homework. he gives homework problems on wiley that dont come close to problems u see on exams he also posts homework assignments late.he doesnt post grades on spark, and you cant bring up your grade other than exams"
3194,good,Guys I took this class in summer and online. I would strongly suggest you buy the textbook. Read the chapters assigned and then do the homework's and later on go to the quizzes on connect. 85% of the questions on the exam come from the connect. Practice them over and over again. I worked a lot for this class. u Need to understand the material well.
627,average,I took this course to get ahead in credits so I could continue to graduate on time. I do not recommend taking this course online because all of his lectures are 1 1/2 hour long power points that you have to watch all of to see whats on the test. His reviews for each test also give you no insight into what his tests will be like.
3174,poor,"You do not have to come to class, because even if you come to the classroom, you will not be learning anything from her. Mostly, you have to teach yourself throughout the semester. Very challenging instructor, getting an A is quite possible if you invest ridiculous amount of time on practicing the Connect homework and quizzes.  DON'T TAKE HER !"
1786,average,Half the lecture is totally irrelevant story-telling. Pretty annoying. Just restates everything she put in the book.
1971,good,LOVE HER! She uses interesting examples and always tries to make everone laugh. Her tests aren't too hard and she offers a lot of extra credit. I definitely would recommend her class!
2821,average,not bad
2545,good,"his notes ARE pretty good, and he's so nice"
883,poor,"class is almost almost useless, hard to prepare for tests."
1091,good,"A down-to-earth guy. Multiple true/false tests are a drag, though."
382,poor,This is the worst class I have ever taken!!! I do not recommend this class!! It sucks.
1702,poor,"THIS MAN IS THE WORST PROFESSOR @ UMASS. he doesn't take questions in class, goes over problems way too fast and with no clear direction to them. he doesn't use numbers in his problems ever even if a student yells to him that he should. if you are going to take Math 127 take it with Calden. I failed and will have to wait to declare my major."
3370,poor,"this lady is whack... she doesnt care about the studetns at all, and is very hard to deal with"
1907,poor,"Teacher gone CrazY!... so unclear, her mind is all over the place. honestly, worst teacher ive ever had. So unorganized, SO unclear. Waste of time to show up to her class. SHES NUTS."
2886,good,"The course material is long and sometimes dry. But he does a good job of teaching. Do the readings, attend lectures, and apply what you learn to day-to-day life and you'll find that an A is easy. U of T is a rigourous school, and anything less challenging than his course would be a waste. Don't be lazy, put the effort in and you'll do fine."
31,good,Terrific teacher!  I love her!  Makes the topic interesting!
2583,poor,All the bads things people have said about her on this website is 100% TRUE. She is not friendly and gives major attitude when you ask her for help for assignments. She always directs you to the TA. She started off the year very nice then she became a totally different person by week 3. She doesnt seem to like her job. Avoid her at all costs!!!!!
2856,average,"Avoid the course at all cost, unless you love memorizing..."
3409,poor,"Way to anal about cheating, but the accounting department seems to be that way in general.  Went through lectures too fast and was harsh with answering questions and grading projects."
610,good,"Mr. Everett's class was very difficult for me, but worth it! I learned so much from him and he always gave fairly specific feedback on papers. His powerpoints are LONG so be prepared to write and do all the examples he gives. Recommended to anyone wanting to transfer to a 4-year university and really be prepared. "
570,good,"he is a decent prof, he tries hard"
2347,good,"Very engaging prof, talks at a very reasonable pace. I personally thought he went a bit too slow but to be fair I do have a fairly solid chemistry background.  He always pours his bottled water into this tiny little mug that he carries around with him everywhere; quite amusing. Overall, engaging lectures, clear grading criteria."
343,good,"Dr. Molumby is a FANTASTIC professor.  This class is not for slackers or those that don't go to lecture or read the text book, and it is TOUGH!  I read everything I could and attended all but 3 lectures, I ended up with a 'B' it was the toughest 'B' I ever earned.  Dr. Molumby is very professional and really cares about his students.  good Class"
2325,average,thanks for the early days when hockey or basketball is on!! You rock!
3065,poor,"The chem labs are very very bad classes, and Moylan's a terrible lecturer. The lectures make no sense and are basically useless. Don't even go. If you get a bad lab TA, you're screwed. I worked my ass off in Chem 36 and still got a B. Then I learned and took Chem 130 CR/NC and did almost no work."
4364,good,Prof. Dennis is great -- class is pretty easy. Sometimes lectures are a little boring but the material and text are interesting. I'd recommend him.
3600,good,Fondufe is easily one of the best prof. i took this semester. Her powerpoints are online so u dont need to even get a book.She is extremely knowledgeable on the subject. One drawback is her tests are really hard and all of the information from the ppt is reworded so u basically have to know it inside and out to get an A
3868,good,"You will DIE in Dr. Buaman's class. (In a good way of course) She is energetic and really cares about her students. She clearly teaches you about art and makes it fun. Her stories are great and make the class more interesting. The class consists of pop quizzes, but if you read you will be fine. Exams are clear and concise, just read and take notes."
2952,good,"Great teacher and human being. Incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and kind. The best!"
1509,poor,No Comments
1736,poor,No Comments
2104,poor,Brym made material that could have been interesting very boring.
1135,good,"Randy is a great guy, he is funny and usually makes class not boring,reads the police reports at the beginning of class, however sometimes he goes off into his own little rants. The class isn't what you may think bio 100 would be...it's not memorizing different parts of the plant and animal cells and learning what a nucleotide is...its more the bio"
3810,poor,"This class is easy if you actually come and take notes. Her study guides take forever to do, but if you do them you'll probably get an A."
3338,good,"Great teacher. Just attend class, take notes, and read. She gets an average rating simply b/c its hard to review previous graded tests unless its conveinient for the teacher aid. Its hard to study for finals w/o the inconvienience of having to look at previous tests when they are conveinient for the teacher aid."
841,average,"The professor is funny, but going to his class is pointless because he doesnt know how to teach."
3861,good,"She's a very helpful teacher that will cut you slack if you need it. I recommend her to anyone that is looking to take Art History. You have to take good notes to pass, there is no other way"
4379,poor,"Terrible teacher with ambigious exams, very poor lecture skills as well. Avoid if possible."
965,good,"Easiest A ever! Definitely take your junior writing class with him. Never bored you in class. Great guy, very friendly, approachable, and willing to help you out with whatever problems you are facing. Highly recommend!"
528,good,"I really liked her, she was so nice, and helpful.I did very well in her class and she got me intrested in the subject. TAke her"
176,good,"This beautiful man. He oozes charisma, and his lectures actually made me want to go to class. He's a decorated and well traveled biologist - but beware. Him and Dr. Brown's exams are made for you to fail. He teaches well but adds things you never expect to the exam. never got above a 65 percent in the class but with lab and lecture points got a B."
422,average,"his a cool prof. as long as you keep up with reading AND attend lecture for his 'power point lecture notes' you'll be fine. BEWARE though, exams are difficult, they are all practical questions, so must prepare good."
3360,poor,very confusion on the test
4116,poor,Worst professor ever.  Do yourself a favor and look at the ratings on here and don't take him.  I didn't and I ended up in his class.  It was every bit as bad as the comments on here.
2408,good,"Great lecturer, but midterms are VERY difficult."
1377,good,"amazing professor! classes are extremely interactive and fun...you will smile the whole time. she's very clear and teaches w/ powerpoints, plus gives you note outlines. You drop your lowest exam plus get do lots of extra credit (but you probably won't need it). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
572,good,good!!!!!!
3204,average,"Professor Hylton speaks very fast, which makes lectures pretty short. I would recommend studying the connect questions before each exam (there's a total of three unit exams).  The unit exams are definitely manageable if you take the time to study.  The final exam was the hardest, in my opinion, but still manageable. "
288,poor,HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE KENNY LOGGINS!
3496,good,"Prof. Fondufe was good! Be prepared to put in a lot of work though. I did poorly at first because I tried to take notes in class, but then I started studying the powerpoints outside of class and I managed a B. She gives a few iClicker quizzes, so be in class for those! She's very energetic and helpful."
1729,average,"The professor is funny, but going to his class is pointless because he doesnt know how to teach."
3123,average,he's ok but hard exams
2153,good,"His style of teaching is absolutly impressive. So clear, not boring at all, makes a class of 1400 seem like 140. Definatly a must take class, i only took it for a social science and i ended up majoring in SOC cuz of him!"
2111,poor,"Course is really easy. I wouldn't recommend going to class, All he does is read off the book he wrote. I don't like the guy, I feel like he was rude to me because of my background, from what I hear though, hes like that to everyone. These views are based on my experience with the guy, you may have a different experience. *shrugs* not a fan."
3076,good,"Crystal clear explanation of subject, never goes too fast. Eccentric at time, but always in a humorous way. Ask him if math is real."
4383,poor,"poor, poor, poor. Made **** comments. Tests are too hard and don't cover any material discussed in class. NEVER AVAILABLE to students. He should definitely not be teaching!"
3084,poor,"Poorly structured lectures and class in general, things weren't taught in the optimal order in my opinion. The course structure was hard to follow and assumed you already knew a lot of stuff."
1864,good,very very smart teacher. exams are a wee bit difficult if you don't study and try. do to the extra credit discussions. they actually help and you get extra credit. she's wacky in a good way. go to lectures.
1954,good,"Human Biology was my favorite class this semester. Professor Goodenough has designed the course so that it's almost impossible not to earn an A. Her lessons are interesting, she holds reviews before tests, and there are many extra credit opportunities. She genuinely cares about helping students learn and succeed. I highly recommend this course."
4277,good,"Professor Dennis is the sweetest professor you will ever have. He really cares about all of his students and tries to get to know them, he's so kind it warms my heart.  He really has a passion for teaching, tests and quizzes are easy. you don't have to come to class but read the book and be fine"
383,poor,"His lectures are more entertaining than Murray. He is a cool guy. However, his tests suck!! Memorize the lectures & read the chapters if you want to do well. Do all the lab work cause it will save you in the end. Genetic test is the hardest. If you are not a bio person do not take his class!!!"
3674,good,"Great Professor, explains everything very clearly.  She's nice and you'll learn a lot.  test comes from notes and study guide available. one exam dropped"
370,good,"Good lecturer.  Tells you whats on exams, which are still challenging.  Class average for his exam was are 55%, but it is full of idiots.  Does not take late work, I tried, but he at least has a good reason for it."
2355,good,God-tier prof
3935,good,"Wonderful teacher with a crazy cool personality (which makes for a very entertaining class)! Really knows her stuff and is passionate about the subject. She really gets you to like and appreciate art. Three exams (not cumulative), which are easy if you go to class, take notes, and at least glance back at the material. Highly recommended!"
4202,poor,"Why does GMU hire professors like her&#63;  I don't think there is anything special about reading the publisher's slides and pretending like they are your own.  I think she should be fired because she is not here to serve students, but wants to get one over on them.  As for her concepts, they suck.  Obviously so does her teaching."
1105,good,"I really liked Professor Phillis's class. I was confused at first because his teaching methods and tests are very different than anything I've ever had, but I really liked it becauuse it made you think."
2287,poor,how can you respect a guy who makes you buy his text book and then reads from it

141,good,It took me a half an hour just to understand one question on the final.
4181,poor,teacher requests;  but I would not submit an on-line evaluation through GMU.they record your email(attached to G#)you verify its you with checkbox attach to your review(say they don't give your name to teacher) but it is traceable if requested. Rules Change. it could come back to haunt you if you say anything negative on the GMU site.
491,good,"very good teacher, keeps the class interested!! as long as you keep up with your readings you will do well!"
1615,poor,"ugghh...velcro shoes+ugghh... pony tail+ugghh big, ugly ring= wierdo!"
198,good,"If you study past exams you'll do fine but DONT depend only on past exams bc he changes small things each year that can trip you up. Overall great professor--bonus points bc he's a metal head! He's an good guy who really cares about the science of biology, and u can tell just by listening in class. Take him if you can! Beware of long lectures."
2530,good,He is very helpful and makes chemistry interesting!
4266,good,40% of the class is the lab and 3 exam together worth 60%.  Lab very easy.  Exam=Study review sheet=A...try to take Tiffany Bludau=A for nice Ass.
1171,average,"Phillis obviously knows biology, but he seems to have great difficulty getting ideas across...he likes to surprise us on the exams. He's a somewhat nice guy but can be condescending."
1226,good,This is my favorite class and I'm going to miss it when the semester is over
1992,good,One of the BEST gen eds at UMass. Just like a high school anatomy class. She gives so much extra credit and extra grades (term paper) to boost up your grade that it is very hard not to get an A.
1422,good,Makes class interesting. She is a very good lecturer and she is also hot.
3598,poor,I could barely understand a word that came out of her mouth and I have dealt with many accents before. Horrible. Sure she is energetic but she does not make the class interesting. I would rate her VERY low!!!
1714,poor,"Prof. Cook has good intentions but doesn't know how to teach his material. He is often late and unprepared, and can't answer questions clearly when asked. You practically have to teach yourself how to do all the work in the class, the lectures are no help."
3842,good,"She is the best professor I have ever had. She is kind, inspirational, and knows her stuff. If you ever get the chance, take a class with her."
2063,good,This class is very easy because she gives tons of extra credit and drops the lowest exam grade
195,poor,"I didn't like him or the class, but I got an A. This class is easier than Bios 100 with Malchow for sure."
1556,poor,"Worst teacher ever! Do not take this class. He is totally useless because he doesnt explain anything, just mumbles about nothing and writes down every word he mumbles. I do NOT recommend him. Save yourself, or if you take it, take advantage of the review sessions with the TA."
3721,average,Dr. Largen was really boring but very nice. She was always there to help so get the help when you can! 
874,poor,going to class is useless! he doesn't teach
2887,average,I am an Engineer who took Soc as an elective. I really enjoyed this class and found it really easy. I had 6 courses overall with this semester but this was by far the least course load. As long as you do your weekly readings ( 3 hours each) you'll do fine on the term tests. UNDERSTAND what is written rather than memorize and you'll do fine!
3903,good,"Dr. Bauman is just WONDERFUL. Geneds are a waste of time for many, but like Dr. Bauman says, this class, ARTH 101, will be the MOST influential class you take (and this is coming from a science major). She ignites in your a fire to see the world, and is passionate about her subject, something that's hard to find amongst professors at George Mason."
3902,good,"This class is so easy. All you have to do is attending the class and you won't have have to study 1 week before exams. I only looked over the notes the night before and I got an A in the class. Professor Bauman is such an inspiring and interesting person you will not regret having her. Textbook was a joke, don't waste money buying it"
840,poor,"haha this guy is a joke. i dont understand why peopole like him are allowed to teach, cus he doesnt know how. Dont even bother going to class. i went to  maybe 4 classes all semester. and i have an a-. sooo just pretty much teach yourself using the owls."
581,average,yeah all i can say is... STOP TALKING.!!! i can't hear down HERE! Don't pack up i am nOT done yet
4318,good,"He's a very nice man, very fair tester as well. His test questions are applications of the stuff you learn in the textbook, but he also has some questions from the lectures so attend class and take notes. He's always willing to answer questions and help you out. He gives a lot of examples in the lectures. He's a great professor. I recommend him."
1592,poor,absolutely does not teach anything . . . don't even bother going to class . . . everyone teaches everyone else
1627,average,"Cook has been teaching for so long that he has his lectures pre-scripted in his head. He will teach Calculus to you but the math department at UMass is known for striving for student success. Do all the homeworks, use the video guides, go to review and discussion. Just pay a lot of attention in series! Most students fail here."
905,good,Lectures are fun and interesting. She really tries to help students understand and relate material to current society. She shows videos to help that. The only complaint I have is her tear-out assignments are pretty difficult.
631,poor,"All I can say is, his expectations are difficult and he is very confusing. During class time, there is a lot to go over but he gets off topic. You can do the reading assignments all you want, but that doesn't mean you'll pass. Save your money, time, and GPA and take another instructor."
3415,good,"Im taking her now: she is excellent, clear, and wants her students (those who make the effort to make it) to learn.  I don't blame her for being harsh on some--one lazy bum shuffled in half hr late, walked across her, and she reamed him out.  Be more accountable, folks!"
1578,average,"by far the worst professor i have ever had, unclear, confusing and just plain terrible!"
162,poor,"Oh boy. If you like a professor with 200+ slides on his powerpoints, with each slide being nothing but paragraphs/unformatted pictures, hes your guy. If you like unpredictable tests with fun facts, literally fun facts as the questions, hes your guy. If you like typos on everything including your own lab book, hes your guy. Worst prof ive had at UIC"
2459,good,such a cutie
3804,good,"This class is fine!! Yeah, it's a little boring, but it's only a gen-ed so chill. All you need to do is work on the study guides to get an A. I bring them to class and fill them out while she's teaching so I don't have to later. It's soooo easy, just take it and get it over with. And btw- she's so nice and tried REALLY hard to engage the class."
3823,good,"Largen is a very soft spoken & extremely nice teacher. Its not the teacher, its the class. The class is an assimilation of all sciences that's why the material is long, hard and boring. But just read the slides and do her study guide. Don't buy the book..waste of money!!!"
2154,good,"Good, and engaging speaker. However he is pretty biased. Every topic covered centered around how material inequality is the root of all society's problems. Made it sound like the rational and moral thing to do is increase taxes and make more attempts to help the poor. Although I guess that's what sociology is so I can't blame him."
617,good,"I took this class online and was at first very intimidated by the syllabus. However, Professor Everett absolutely loves what he teaches and is passionate about seeing his students succeed. I set my mind to understanding the material and doing the extra, which got me an A in the class. Professor Everett is the best online professor I have taken!"
3154,poor,"Avoid her class at all costs.  Average teacher, but the tests are far too difficult.  She speaks too quickly and is frequently rude to other students.  Just don't take her class."
1431,good,"Amazing professor. Very funny, makes the class go by soo fast!"
925,good,Great Professor !! i have taken a few classes with her and she is by far one of the best teachers i have ever encountered. her classes were so interesting and insightful i changed my major from psychology to criminology.
3311,good,"Hylton was pretty cold-shouldered and was pissed if you walked into class in the mid of lecture. I got an A in the class, but had to study my butt off for it, like studying for hours on weekends before exams. Do the homework/practices and DEFINITELY attend recitation (that's basically where you learn it all). TA Justin's good. Not bad w/ hard work!"
547,good,"McPike has a great grasp on the material, is very helpful, and very kind.  It was a great class, I'd recommend her to anyone."
1830,good,"Professor Whitebourne is an easy teacher, yes, you don't need to go to class but if you want an easy A (which is what this class was an easy A): go to class, take notes, write down REVIEW POINTS, sit there and smile. HOWEVER, she is extremely full of herself and obsessed with the Aging topic and population. Also tries to conform you to gerontology"
1566,poor,No Comments
1694,average,Prof. Cook is a very nice man but his class is very difficult. You must go to class to have somewhat of an idea as to what's going on. I was required to take this class for my major and I am absolutely horrible at math. I ended up with a C- probably because I met with him to discuss exams and made it clear that I was trying my best.
2450,good,his tests were brutal. but he's pretty hot (from the balcony) LOL
1822,average,"Wicked easy class. The review points at the end of each lecture comprise all of the questions on the exams. She was annoying, but the material was a breeze."
3151,poor,His tests only focus on a randomly selected 5% of the material - it's so ridiculous.  Someone who knows virtually nothing on the chapter can walk out with an A while someone who has mastered most of the chapter gets a C.  You have to be lucky to do well.
2488,good,No Comments
611,good,Professor Everett was one of the most passionate professors I have ever seen and that was only after an online class. I would recommend him to anyone need to take Brit Lit II. I learned so much and wash challenged in the best ways possible.
1336,good,AMAZING!
3273,average,"It says something when there are two Hylton classes unfilled, and Harley has one with a long waitlist. She comes across as very rude/condescending, and as someone below said, she's really anal about laptops/phones. Calls you out on it, too. Hates it if you're late. Treats you like you're 10. MUST study *****A LOT***** for an A. Bottom line - avoid."
640,good,"I just finished this class today.  I'm not going to say it was an easy class, but it was not hard either.  A lot of writing.  I definitely recommend this taking this course.  Mr. Everett was very helpful."
930,good,She is the BEST professor I have ever taken!!!! I like to stop by her office every now and then just to keep in touch with her. You will love her and especially love going to her classes!
2314,average,"very cocky prof.  tests were written very unfairly, they were way too specific!"
3297,good,"A good teacher in a bland subject.  She expects student conduct to be high, some folks don't like that but I found it to be helpful when students were told to stop talking or stop texting...its distracting and rude.  The course is hard, study and read, do the homework (every week) and attend her reviews."
742,poor,I didnt take Calc in High School so I went in expecting to learn it. Nope. If you take his class get ready to spend hours in the help center in Lederle and the LRC. Looking at the review for the exam makes you realize exactly how little he covered during lecture. 
637,good,"Learned a lot in this class. If you can write a decent essay you will do fine. Just a lot of work with little to no time between essays. He grades hard, no slack. He covers a ton load of literature, so get ready to read. Mr. Everett wants you to walk away from his class with the tools for the future and not just the letter grade."
2304,average,"interesting material, but he regurgitates the text in lectures. kinda cocky"
3852,good,"I originally thought I was going to hate this class and it would be a bore, but I actually looked forward to this class every week! She has a ton of energy and is hilarious in class. DEFINITELY TAKE HER. She doesn't put PowerPoints on BlackBoard so you have to show up to class to get the notes or else you're lost. Her exams are straightforward."
2405,poor,"extremly unclear focus on lectures; He spent an entire lecture on naming molecules, to tell us later that he will never question naming...wtf&#63;&#63;&#63; If you can score above 80 in his class, you are a genius. his test average is usually 45%-56%!!"
2313,good,FANTASTIC PROF
1097,poor,"the whole class is basically about memorizing diagrams. quizzes once a week..he will be very unclear about how he grades the class. you won't know your grade until after the final exam. difficult class, confusing at times..TAKE NOTES."
2292,poor,I found out that sociology was more than this!
48,good,His classes were the highlight of my week.
2858,poor,"One of the hardest 2nd Yr course i've ever done, and he's not that useful too.."
3193,average,"Took it online during summer. Material is not that hard, but since it's a crash course that's what makes it harder. You need to digest so much info within a very short time ( 4 weeks). Get ready to study on ur own, as there no recorded prof. lectures.  But take advantage of all the online resources, mastering those helps a lot on tests & final."
921,good,This teacher is amazing! Shes great and she thinks of the students first! She is very opinionated and isn't afraid to say whats on her mind. I took one of her online classes and she randomly sent everyone an email stating that we may have had a hard week in our other classes so the quiz and discussion board for the week was canceled. TAKE HER!

3246,average,"Avoid her if you can. She's a hard grader, takes points off for minimun stuff...she took points off from my hw bc the printing was not clear enough and at the of the semester she didn't let me see my final exam. Class is hard, so be prepared! 1 midterm and non-cumulative final"
756,poor,"all he talks about is archimedes, galileo, isaac newton, and isaac barrow. does not teach the material and tests are completely different from what he talks about. this man should be ashamed of himself"
4286,average,"Super easy class, read the book and you'll do fine. He's a nice guy, but tends to ramble during lectures (he doesn't mind if you fall asleep though). The subject is kind of repetitive and very theoretical. Mostly just memorize the sociologist's names and corresponding theories and tests will be a piece of cake. "
2804,good,"Very steep learning curve.  If you read his lectures for the first time, they seem disorganized and proofs jump out from no where.  But if you put effort into understanding it, the lecture notes are sufficient and you begin to appreciate smart ways he presents proofs.  The TAs were very kind and helpful as well. got 100% with hard work..its doable."
2432,good,okay professor
4310,poor,"Its was very easy, you don't need to attend class because nothing he says is useful honestly. As long as you use the text book and answer the study guide you'll get an A+. Its really easy, I googled the terms I didn't understand and still got an A- on my test"
2210,good,"Lectures are always well organized and coherent. His explanations are easy to understand and he speaks at a good pace and repeats important concepts so you dont have to worry about missing things from a lecture. course website useful and up to date. fair tests, nice guy, fun to learn. best prof."
1886,good,"Overall, a pretty good class. She makes a sensitive subject better to talk about. A little spacey and ditsy....but a very intelligent woman."
4051,poor,"Even if you don't have him listed as your instructor.  He's still the guy that gives your professors the homework and tests.  This class is the reason i am not majoring in network security.   Not because its hard, but rather the feeble minded department heads like lyons. He is a control freak, but at the same time very knowledge in the subject."
2592,average,"Unless accounting is completely new to you, dont go to class. She does a fine job of compressing 2 hours of textbook reading into a 3 hour class. Dont go to class, read the text, and watch for the minor details they can catch you on. Dungan and Oesch are great, shes a complete drag on the course. Not bad to look at though!"
1919,good,No Comments
836,good,"ppl are u guyz serious&#63;&#63;&#63; Cook is not that bad, I mean hes funny and enthusiastic to teach. The only problem i had with him was that most times he spent alot of time explaining an simple problem which made it more confusing. Overall his class is not bad at all."
2498,good,"i like his notes, i understand his notes....his notes make me less confused (which isn't all that much seeing as how my confusion is so far beyond help that not even einstein himself would try)....so yea, good notes..."
1727,poor,Cook makes this a really hard class. He refuses to actually teach the material by using examples and going over things step by step. According to him thats not his job. His job is to teach mathmatics not to hold your hand. He goes off topic a lot to complain about cell phones and calculators. If you can take any other teacher for calc I suggest it.
3607,good,"Fondufe was very energetic in her explanations. She explains well and gives very detailed slides but you REALLY cant guess anything on the tests. It is extremely detailed in what it asks for. However, if you read and know theh text book left and right then you'll be fine."
4257,average,"Ok professor, she doesn't seem to have much real world experience, I believe most of her examples are her research findings. If you have management experience (from the real world) the class isn't hard."
1831,poor,"Easy A. BUT, most unbearable class ever. I know more about her personal life than psychology because EVERYTHING is about her. She talks down to people and acts like she could never be wrong. Opitomy of annoyance. Bring earplugs and just copy the review points"
3307,poor,"I hate this class. Her TA's are snobby and rude. They act better than you for being 30 and making minimum wage. I find her personally annoying and her class painful. I hated every single moment I spent there. Unfortunately, you're stuck because she's the only one the teaches the class at this glorified commuter school."
1582,poor,He's the worst professor I've ever had...he doesn't explain anything and he spends the class writing down everythinghe says as he says it and says Uhhh....way too much....He's a terrible teacher....
3241,average,Just finished Acccounting 203 with Hylton.  I doubt any accounting majors made these comments so far.  Do yourself a favor and if you aren't serious about college don't take her because it will just hurt your gpa and you'll whine about her forever.  If you are an accounting major take her
1070,poor,"Worst class I've ever taken, very confusing way of teaching. his exams are really hard and he's very unclear in class. you'll never know your grade and he will not reply to your emails."
4231,average,The lectures are a bit boring but not difficult.  Most of the work is done in lab.  Exams are pretty hard.
1283,good,"I love Professor Rahhal! Her lectures are never boring, she knows how to keep it interesting and even though there are 470 kids in the class she knows how to get students to engage with each other. She drops 2 online quizzes, 1 exam, and 1 writing assignment. There is no final exam, because the 4 tests (3 counted) are non-cumulative!"
4362,poor,the only class i've ever actually fallen asleep in.
2889,poor,"Tepperman's lectures are long and his ideas are not organized well. He expects everyone to think like he does that's why he sets 100 multiple choice questions for the tests. I would advise people who hate memorizing to reconsider taking this course, because that's all there is to be honest. The readings are essential to passing."
4183,poor,"this was my first time taking an online class, i really hated. there was no other teacher that teach in class available. the information was not very clear and the test was not related to the material i studied somewhat. the Qs on the test were tricky, the answers were very similar which confuse the hell out of students who taking her exams."
3247,average,The class has a lot of material but was not that difficult to understand. READ THE BOOK. She disrupted class numerous times for students coming in late which personally I found ridiculous. Come the class before exams; she covers the test material. She was not helpful and very rude when I informed her I had a problem with the online hw.
3580,poor,Just Hated this professor and her teaching!
4170,poor,Spring semester is always difficult. Crazy class. I think we should this class in Summer or Fall.
1326,good,She is a good teacher. A lot of notes on  her slides and she kinda goes fast. READ the hauke book for the in class writing. it was the difference between a B and an A- for me. Great class overall
1647,good,"He isn't bad at all. He's a joker and a half and he tells you what will be on the exams. If you go to class and do the pactice problems in the class, you'll probably get an at least a B+"
3658,average,"Nice lady, but HARD teacher.  Gives way too many notes, and expects you to memorize and understand far too much information and far too many concepts.  If you're a biology major, she's probably a good teacher to have.  If you're not, you'll be in way over your head."
2640,poor,She just reads off the slides.
2755,poor,No Comments
3875,good,Amazing professor! She makes you want to actually show up to class and her tests are straight forward. Super nice and funny too
3551,good,Dr. Fondufe is full of life and fun. Her study guides make exams easy. Pretty straightforward class overall.
3576,good,"She's good. I took her for Bio 103 and 104 and I would def. recommend her!! If you bother going to lecture, she's knows what she's talking about but if you miss class all of her notes are online. Tests can be tricky but study the power points and you'll be fine. Very easy to get an A or B. DON'T BUY THE BOOK, you don't need it for her class!"
2016,good,"Dr. Goodenough is the best professor I've had at UMASS. She is very funny and always kept class interesting. I took it as a &quot;team taught&quot; course, and out of the 3 professors I had, she was by far the best. I recommend it as a GenEd for anyone who needs a BS or just more credits, and I recommend Dr. Goodenough for anyone who wants an good professor."
4158,good,"Expect alot of work in his class. Doesn't tolerate s*** from his students. Takes mad attendence. Threatens to remove lecture slides if class attendence is low. If you go to class, he will help you otherwise forget it."
1835,good,she is very energentic and it makes her class that much more interesting.
1373,good,She does a great job at teaching a lecture of 500. Her exams are pretty easy. All you need to do is read the modules that she assigns. She allows a ton of extra credit which is a plus. She's just an entertaining professor.
3715,good,Very good except for the laboratory sections. Perfect for a science gen ed. requirement 
2815,poor,he did not do a good job in delivering the material
3456,poor,"Very nasty teacher, don't ever slam the door or she freaks, she fails many of her student, the secret is keep up on your homework"
867,average,"He covers the same material for about 3 weeks straight.  Tests are pretty easy, but he isn't always clear in lecture.  Easy to get a good grade in his class."
926,good,"Best prof ever!.I have been to colleges in Nigeria,Canada,&USA.Thats more than half way across the earth globe,and all thru the Atlantic ocean.I would say this is the best prof that ever lived on earth. i took this class in 2010.If you cnt get at least a B in this class,you got real problems."
3773,good,EASY CLASS!!!! GREAT FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT SCIENCE MAJORS AND JUST NEED THE CREDIT!!!! SHE IS AN good AND EASY TEACHER!!!!
997,good,"I struggled with this class at first, esp. being my first semester of freshman year, but definitely attend every lecture. His powerpoints are directly related to his exams, and you can only understand the material if you pay attention in class. If you tend to zone out or it still does not click in, GO SEE GARBIS at the LRC! He is the best tutor!!"
1337,good,"Being an International Student, I find her good."
3579,good,She is a nice lady. All you have to do is study the powerpoints and you should do fine on the exams. Class is not mandatory...(she tells you when the quizes are going to be)
1099,poor,I hated this class.  I would only suggest it if biology is your major and you have taken AP Bio in highschool. I did not understand anything and no one I knew in the class did either. I left the class knowing less about biology then I did going it.  He was really vauge on how he was going to grade.  I got a D.
1132,good,"At the beginning of the semester, you will be confused as hell. But once you get used to his system and go to all of his review sessions, it is not that hard to get a grade of B or above. Tests are fairly easy but there are some challenging questions as well. My favorite class thie semester."
2004,good,good teacher who seems to really love what she does. She uses countless examples and tries very hard to simplify information to help students.
2115,good,"I am absolutely shocked by all these negative comments. Professor Brym's lectures are straightforward and interesting. He is very well-spoken! The course isn't the easiest, but if you actually engage in this class through taking notes and doing the readings you will earn the credit while having learned something of practical importance. Brym <3!"
210,poor,"he is a horrible prof. we can barely hear him. To get a good grade, try to get as many small points as possible. This is exactly what I did and ended up w/ A. Such as get A in presentations, problem sets & lab reports. And then obviously study for exams. Must get old exams from friends in order to do well coz he recycles the old exam questions."
4336,good,"really nice guy but class was boring..he gives study guides for tha exams so i recommend doing them..so it was ok, could have been better"
2208,poor,"i honestly have to say that he is the wrost prof. ever.  he is condescending, arrogant and rude.  not to mention that he calls his students liars, when they face him with the reality that he is the one not telling the truth."
59,good,"I love him so much, such an good professor. Only if i had a teacher like him, in goo'ol early days."
1211,good,The best professor I've had in my 4 years at college. Makes biology more fun and makes you think hard. Has a good sense of humor but very disciplined.
2456,average,"Prof Browning has an easygoing nature and is humourous, but his test was pretty hard.."
1972,good,BEST PROFESSOR EVER.  It was my favorite class I took in college and I don't like science at all.
4340,good,"I don't understand how anyone could dislike this man!  He is so nice!  Also, his class is simple, he hands out a sheet the literally lists everything that's going to be on the test.. if you study it there's no way you can fail! I love him, I can tell he loves teaching and he tries so hard to make jokes.. it's cute"
1705,poor,"Do yourself a favor and ignore all the ratings that say that he is of any help. I had a 3.8 GPA until I took this class, and FAILED my first college test with this guy. He might be a nice guy but he should have retired 30 years ago. I attended all of his lectures, along with turoing, and BOTH reviews before the test. Got 60's on first two tests."
765,poor,"Avoid Cook at all costs. Easily the worst professor I've ever had. He exams are nothing like the practice exams, homeworks, SI sessions, or what he does during lecture. Even the TA can't figure out what Cook is asking in exam questions. Very misleading. Even if you work hard, your final grade is left to luck. He never checks his email."
2493,good,"This guy owns as a prof. He loves his chemistry, and tries to explain things as if he's teaching a first year class, not lecturing to Nobel laureates."
4121,poor,"There was little to no explanation on the project, which is 25 percent of your grade, and he would rather make you feel stupid then help you understand what he wants you to do."
1078,average,"Alright Biotappers, this is a logic class so learn to think the way he thinks and you will get an A. Refuse to go through what he says is right then its most likely going to be a B. You almost never use the book so just share with someone else. If you had a great bio teacher, get ready for the worst. He procrastinates and personally doesnt teach."
4136,good,"With Lyons, your either going to love him or hate him. I thought he was a great instructor, and I learned from the course. Very helpful with going over the assignments and homeworks. Don't try to bull**** your way through his class and expect an A."
2787,poor,"You are either one of 3 students, someone that already knows all the proofs, somebody that will fail, or somebody that will memorize about a hundred past exam questions and pass with a 70. No other way to deal with this course"
1538,poor,"save yourself, i got an A and still hate the dude!!  judt poor. had to teach myself and after the first 4 weeks never went to class because he never said anything worth hearing"
2426,good,I love him! he is by far the best prof I have had all year! Hes a treat and makes me want to go chemistry - which is hard to accomplish!
2409,good,Organic Chemistry is...how to put it in clearly understandable terms...murder.
2451,good,great!
582,good,Very lively lectures especially when he does experiments in class.
2329,average,"The guys is so full of himself and yes, his lectures are all out of the book"
3909,good,"One of the best classes I've taken. INCREDIBLE professor! You will learn SO MUCH in this course. Be prepared, it's a no BS class. You are going to have to work, but more importantly use your brain and challenge it. I'd take any class with her if only I were an ARTH major."
3570,average,Very energetic teacher.  Test questions written more complicated than needed.  She likes questions beginning with &quot;which one of these is NOT...&quot; Arrgh!
940,good,Had her three times she is the best. Love her. MUST TAKE!!!!!!!
1080,average,Randy's class was based on logic. He assigned 4 chapters to read all semester- none of which were necessary for the exams. We didn't get any quiz grades back from the weekly quizzes because he wanted us to ponder the questions all semester. He put the exam answers up about a month after the exams. He used PRS every class. Overall didn't learn much.
187,good,"He was a great professor, the lectures were always very interesting. He  definitely cares about the students as long as he sees you are trying. The labs are pretty easy and straight forward. Take good notes during lecture, you can honestly pass the test just off of this. He gives great examples during lecture, understand it and you'll be ok."
941,good,"Had her three times this semester, and I wouldn't have gotten my gpa where it could be without her. Her lectures aren't boring, easy to understand. Tests are easy, as long as you know the information. Shes my best friend :) Spent most time in her office just talking haha. MUST TAKE!"
2741,poor,No Comments
3664,good,very energetic
2689,average,No Comments
4303,average,Nice professor. It's an easy A class. You don't need to show up and still pass. You just have to read the chapters before the test and quiz and you'll be alright. 
2086,poor,boring
3680,average,"she is an alright teacher, if you are horrible in science do not take her, I talked with her and she says that she has the hardest tests out of the bio department!"
2279,average,"writes his own book EVERY YEAR, killed me and my brothers, what to do with the books&#63;"
226,poor,"I took his bio class about four years ago. I'm in medical school now, and still think his class was more difficult than necessary. Obtain old tests. Give your clicker to someone else. Find old lab reports. Do what it takes to get ahead. I wouldn't be where i am without these tricks."
4009,average,"Theres alot of hate going around with lyons. Most of it is whining. Hes not that bad. yeah hes not a real pleasant guy but he knows his stuff. if you wanna learn take him, he makes you think about security the right way not just reading off the ppt slides. Lyons writes the exams. It wasn't much work, a few assignments, and like 2-3 tests."
535,average,She is da bomb. After class we would smoke a fat bowl in her office and chat the time away comparing and contrasting various philosophers. Take this class if you wanna get high!!
1717,poor,"Worst Teacher. TA test reviews do not help and if you approach Prof. Cook for help, he does nothing for you. Read the book, SI sessions help. Everyone fails that tests, but you should end up with a C if you do the owls."
3816,poor,"Last semester was nice but it fell apart.She gives skeleton notes and expects you to write down everything she says.Thats her way of punishing those who dont come to class.She makes us print out the labs; thats about 2,500 sheets of paper wasted per week; way to teach us to be environmental friendly"
1404,good,tammy rahhal is good...everyone should take her class.  her teaching make me wanna wake up in the morning to take this class...she's spunky and funny and full of life.
3217,poor,Try to find another if possible. She is the rudest teacher you can possibly find in Mason. She is harsh and does not respect students. She thinks she knows a lot and she is the type of person that will not accept she made a mistake even if she did. Her specialty is to step on you and make you feel stupid. I wish I could've dropped her class.
3305,poor,"Avoid her if at all possible. She does not teach the material well and does not want (or is able) to help you outside of class. I can honestly think of no redeeming characteristics she posseses as a professor (for this class at least). If, like me, you have to take her...JAH bless!"
697,good,Wow not as easy as i thought she would be! But its research sooo.. She grades only on Mid(1st part of paper) and final (ure final paper) just choose a good topic and the right group and dont slack ull be fine. shes super nice too so ask and shell help.
1124,good,good!
4372,good,He's okay and very nice...his exams are hard...but if you have him...make sure you do the readings regularly and do the study guide and u'll be in good shape. he gives a lot of xtra credit...i wouldnt even bother goin to lecture...its a waste of time! just go to the review classes!
2172,average,"A very smart professor. However, these needs to be a drastic audit on the methods of evaluation. There should be tutorials, no excuse. BIO150 with comparable size had them. Often, lectures were very dry and simply from the text. TA's not approachable, and useless at times. Monotonous at times. My overall grade for Brym is a c-"
2266,good,No Comments
586,good,"Being his brother, it's hard to find any of his good qualities, but this man is brilliant (relative to most, not me), if you fail his class, perhaps the problem lies in your own stupidity."
2367,good,"Dr. Browning is a very funny professor.  You definitely DO NOT want to miss his lectures, he is a hilarious person, even though some of the CHM stuff is difficult. It is because of him that made chemistry more bearable for the first year."
1400,average,No Comments
3424,poor,definitely needs a new career because she cant teach accounting. doesnt care that the majority of the class has d's and has a more than annoying voice.
2442,good,No Comments
2218,good,Prof Brym is an amazing teacher.  He speaks with charisma and enthusiasm! He is very approachable and communicates well with all.  His website is one of the best maintained of all UofT professors! Tests are not hard--this is UofT; not high school!
1037,poor,He refuses to help when I ask and i've asked multiple times
208,good,"Dr. Molumby is excellent. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about biology. He tells some fascinating stories in class, all of which are relevant and many ended up on exams. His exams are difficult. If it's hard to hear him, just sit closer. It's not his fault - UIC desperately needs to invest in new P.A. systems for the large lecture halls!"
2358,good,"Great lectures. Good explanation of lecture materials, sometimes adds humour to lectures. Tests were next level hard."
565,poor,"worst teacher ever! everyone in his class is smarter than he is, he always makes mistakes.How did he EVER get his PhD&#63; PLEASE GET FIRED!! cuz i can't learn anything from somone who doesnt even know what they are talking about."
313,good,"i love him!! he's nice, very informative, makes material easy to understand and makes it a enjoyable experience. i wish ppl would stop dogging him....HE ROCKS!"
601,average,"As a Brit Lit I student I was not excited about the material until closer to the end of the semester, and English is my major. Although his tests are hard, they are not meant to trick you. I do not think I'll take Prof. Everett next semester, but if you choose to, you better be on top of your writing and grammar game. He expects a lot from you."
233,poor,"He is a great lecturer and interesting to listen to.He uses real life stories to explain the topics. Exam questions are vague and misleading,written deliberately to trick students into choosing wrong answers.It's more about how well you memorize every last detail from about 1600 of his ppt slides than how well you understand the concepts."
3366,poor,"She is disrespectful teacher, I had never seen. She yell at every students. What ever you done, getting low grade. She is not professional. Don't be in her class"
931,good,"She is one of the most influential people in my college career. I stop by her office on the regular (as do many other students). She's very personable, interesting and all around just a wonderful person! She's a great professor, teaches you how it REALLY is, not the way society wants you to see the world. Definitely take her class(es) !! :)"
4060,poor,"A good professor or faculty member knows how to network with his students, as their industry/govt connections and influence can prove to be mutually beneficial for the department or the instructor in the future. Michael Lyons obviously never bothered to  learn this important life lesson. Prof. Bob Quinn needs to be running this department IMHO."
3837,good,"Professor Bauman is a gem of George Mason. She is deeply intelligent and you will walk away from each class a better thinker. She makes things challenging in a productive way. You have to study and take time with this class to get an A, but she will make you want to earn it. Definitely recommend."
4289,average,"He's a very nice man, but his lectures are boring. There were three quizzes, two midterms, and a final. The class is pretty easy if you study and read the textbook. If you're one that likes to skip class, you can definitely still pass if you skip. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's possible."
111,good,"This guy was freakin amazing.  If you've got to take CS106A and you're not too keen on it, you should definitely take it from Mehran.  Seriously.  He even passes out candy in class, so you can't go wrong by going to lecture."
3468,good,"Just stick to the study guides and you'll ace every test she gives you. There's a bit of homework too, but other than that I'd definitely recommend her if you're just trying to pass the gen ed"
1089,average,"Class based on logic and reasoning through diagrams than on actually learning content. Personally found it straightforward but a lot of people thought he was very unclear. Easy if you're good with logic, really hard if you're not. Learning how to reason was kind of useful but felt like we could have learned more actual content."
3264,poor,"I please hope this woman is reading up on what her students think of her.  She is THE most pathetic teacher, and human being on this campus.  Absolutely terrible teaching, because she doesn't teach. She has a nasty attitude to everyone and her class is downright ridiculous. Do not even think about taking class with her."
230,poor,"You don't have to go to his every lecture and read the textbook and still managed to get B in his class.Didn't like his lab reports and problem sets because some of the TA's are really anal about how you write them!To sum up,3 exams the 4th exam is an optional exam.3 problem sets,2 lab reports and 2 presentations."
2170,poor,His lectures are boring and so is the textbook. I could not understand the material nor analyze it correctly. His lectures and material are dry and not interesting. The tests are multiple choice and have some essay questions-extremely hard and detailed. I wish I would have dropped the course sooner or I shouldn't have took the course as an elective
2099,average,"His classes were pretty boring and repetitive. He taught every other lecture and another professor would teach the other lectures. The other professor was better. Pretty tough tests, as all Sociology tests are. They are always worded confusingly. Read the textbook weekly and you'll get a B or B+"
3525,poor,"If you want to learn biology 103, Dr. Fondufe is not for you. In my opinion she didn?t teach material, she repeated it. For me her problem is not that she moves ?too quickly,? it is that she reviewed concepts I had no prior knowledge of. She seemed to be shouting the slides, leaving most of the material to be self-learned or inferred."
472,poor,"This was a hard class and I'm an honors kid who has an interest in the subject. He knows the subject very well but he taught the 021 class as if it were a class in graduate school. There were only 2 chances to get extra credit and none of them were available past the midterm. Good teacher, but very tough class!"
1894,good,"she didn't seem to be all there but the class was cool. i was kinda sad when it all ended, she takes everything to heart and that makes the students feel special. quizzes and tests are easy...do ur work and u'll do better than expected."
2487,good,"he is soooo sexy, i fantasized all class, which probably explains why i got a B"
2668,poor,No Comments
1912,good,"If you ever have the opportunity take her psych 101 class, and even more important... psych of aging.  I took this class back in 98, and it has staying with me more then any other class i have ever taken.  A degree from UMass is not complete w/o this clas"
1127,good,"Phillis is an amazing teacher. Instead of memorization which is what Bio usually is, he makes almost every concept into a series of puzzles to solve. He is very dedicated to teaching and is really smart. The only problem is his tests are constantly full of typos which confuse the problem... usually he gives you the points though"
2374,good,"Atrocious grammar. He says then on average 2 times per minute. Yes I counted, it drives me crazy. Also explains things in minute detail - so I'm sure everyone and their dog understands, but it gets a little tiresome."
1769,poor,I don't get calculus and he isn't helping much!
3930,good,"Just as everyone says, there are three test non are cumulative. There are 2 papers not more than 2 pages. A very fun and outgoing teacher that I think made me interested in Art History...One of My favorite classes...If need to take Art History she is one of the best. I recommend her..."
4208,poor,"Don't take MGMT301 during regular semester!She don't allow international students use dictornay during the exams, and the paper assignment is really hard to get a good grade!"
2596,poor,not very good lecturer. the lectures is just the textbook repeated. tests are not hard but made to trick you. i didnt enjoy this class
3593,poor,"Questions from the test are ridiculously difficult and are half are reworded directly from the book. The quizzes are the same way; trick questions on EVERY OTHER QUESTION. Powerpoints that are directly from the book software. Are you seeing a pattern&#63; If you need a 103/104 class, take Laemmerzahl. This professor is essentially useless."
3862,good,"I took 3 classes with Dr. Bauman while at GMU - the first was mandatory for fine arts and the other two were out of choice because the first class was so good.  She's an incredible teacher and she honestly changed my life.  Tests are very tied to class material - if you show up and pay attention, you'll be fine.  Tough but fair in grading."
361,good,"Well, I would agree his exams were very difficul. I took him my first year though and didtn put emphasis on the book. If you read the book n memorize his slides you should fair well. He's a great guy still says hi to me"
135,poor,"Worthless teacher, worthless person, just worthless matter"
1134,good,"Phillis is a great guy and is very elaborate in his explanations.  I highly recommend taking his class.  I never really used the book, but if you go to class and lab, you should be fine."
2406,good,"Very clear in class with adequate info in notes. However, the term test was difficult. Final exam was fine. Adorable, funny, and helpful. Favourite prof so far!"
1151,poor,"This man is quite possibly the worste teacher I have ever had. It was best not to listen to what he had to say (I got an A). He drew the most confusing diagrams I have ever seen, and made things more complicated than they needed to be. If you gave this man a good review, then you have never had a good biology teacher. I got a 5 on AP Bio + 740 SAT2"
4131,average,This is the worst class I ever had and the hardest I have ever taken and Mason. Try to take this class with another professor....Professor Lyons knows his stuff but is rude and nasty and the class did not have to be PHd difficult for the students to get the concepts.
3384,good,"Not the easiest teacher, trys to make the class average a C, but not impossible to do better, I had a 60 avg going into the final and passed the class (IDK how though)"
2921,poor,"I wish I never took this course. He does not deserve the esteemed position he holds in this University: he doesn't teach, does not help students and will demean and embarass them any chance he gets. Please avoid this class and avoid making the same mistake that I, and apparently others, did."
1053,poor,"His me tires are almost impossible to follow never mind take notes on and he doesn't communicate well with TAs which makes discussions almost useless. The only savior is the SI of the class and then the exam reviews. If I have the choice I will never take his class again, makes things way more a stressful than they should be."
3939,good,"One of the best professors at Mason. Loves her subject and gets you to love it too. Take notes, study hard, go to class and you'll do well. I got a B+ but I had to work really hard and I am a history and art history major. She just expects a lot from her students but what you give you will get in return. She is FANTASTIC. Take her class!"
22,poor,she comments all the time on how she has a phd yet gets stumped once a period
2303,good,extremely interesting
1653,poor,"Avoid Cook at all costs. Easily the worst professor I've ever had. He exams are nothing like the practice exams, homeworks, SI sessions, or what he does during lecture. Even the TA can't figure out what Cook is asking in exam questions. Very misleading. Even if you work hard, your final grade is left to luck. He never checks his email."
2093,average,"Brym covers the research aspects of sociology, mainly math, and as a social science student it isn't exactly my strong suit, and its confusing to follow. Tells funny jokes occasionally. But make sure you really pay attention to his information, because reading the textbook for his sections does not help, and his section of the test is rough. "
3999,average,"Here are the things you should know about the course and the professor; you cant miss lecture, you should take notes for the entire 3 hours of lecture word by word, group project is 30% and no guidance is provided by the professor, homeworks are concentrated towards the second half. The professor is smart but the course is irrelevant to info-sec."
695,poor,worst professor ever. so unorganized that it's not even worth the A i'm probably going to get. don't buy the books - you never use them. rambles and goes off topic. just stay away!!!
2174,good,"One of the most fair profs of U of T. A rare thing. All you need to do is, KEEP UP WITH THE READINGS...Study sociology every weekend...read the chapter like 3 or 4 times and not leave the reading till the weekend b4 the test, and there is no reason why you should get less than B in the course. Tests are slightly tough, but totally fair. Great prof"
3126,good,No Comments
420,good,Good class. Powerpoint lectures. Labs are easy. Tests are a little hard. Reading the book isn't really necessary-just study the notes.
2389,good,"Dude is my hero.  He made me smart.  Lectures were off the hizzle, but midterm made me cry.  Mmmmmm"
3435,average,"Goes way too fast with material, tests are hard but seem to get easier, just make sure you do good on the project"
460,poor,"He is a very nice teacher and an interesting character. On the other hand, the tests are very difficult. Assigned readings are barely even covered on the test and the notes in class are quite confusing. Would not recommend half of the class have dropped the class."
1067,average,Randall is good
87,good,Best. Prof. Ever.
3188,poor,"In class she literally calls out people who go to the bathroom. She'd rather disrupt class to publicly shame the poor student and say how ""her class isn't a movie theater"" than actually teach it. Also, don't bother showing up if you're even the slightest bit late for class, you will also be ostracized. I think this says a lot about her as a teacher"
2059,good,Easy class.  Grade is based only on a few midterms and the final.  Drops the lowest final.  Goes through material extremely slowly.  Can probably ace the class by reading the material just before the exams.  Recommended if you are looking for an easy A.
3414,good,Its a hard class and she moves very very fast through the material.  She can come off as a little uninterested in helping students but if you go to office hours you will get help.
2420,good,We love him
282,poor,"the exams are hard because he makes them that way intentionally so know your stuff and study for the exams! i got an A from doing well on the first 2 exams, bombed the third one but the final is optional"
3089,good,Nice 
1872,good,Easy to the point of being embarraasing.
2318,good,Brym takes the TTC!! Wow!! He really DOES care about the environment!!
540,good,"She is an extremely nice professor and an easy grader. There are quizzes every day but she gives many opportunities for extra credit. The material and class sessions are VERY boring, but its an easy way to fulfill a PHL requirement."
3450,good,"Can be oversensitive at times, but when she lectures she is interesting to listen to.She gives out review sheets and tells you problems to concentrate on before the test!I went to all classes and studied day of the tests only, 97% going into the final."
3532,good,"Dr. Fondufe is an excellent professor. She is extremely well versed in Biology and she teaches well. She is vibrant and friendly and is very open to asking questions and giving answers. No pressures. Her exams are quite difficult. She is good at posting on BlackBoard and if you read, attend class and pay attention, you'll do well. I enjoyed her."
859,poor,No Comments
533,average,This teacher was way too interested in the sound of her own voice.  I dont think she even understood half the stuff she was saying and most of it was B.S.  She talked to us like we were 4th graders.  Take this class if you want to be bored out of your mind.
1368,good,"I love this class and have not missed one lecture because i really enjoy going!  Professor Rahhal is so funny and makes the class really interactive with all sorts of fun experiments, which really helped me to learn the material better."
3853,good,"Dr. Bauman is exceptionally brilliant but for someone who is not very literate in art, I really struggled. She is REALLY hilarious and has amazing lectures. Although I did not put in enough effort into this class, I would absolutely recommend her. She will help you but get ready to be productive!"
4175,poor,Very rude and I quit because of the way she treated me.
2019,good,Her tests are easy if you go to class.  I didn't go to class for the first test and I did poorly.  Same for the final.  Just go to class and there's no need for the book just study with the notes she gives out.
4258,good,great
3925,good,"This woman is fantastic. She is a brilliant instructor, helpful, funny, interesting. If you need your gen ed class this is fantastic you will fall in love with her! Textbooks are cheap. Just tests and she gives you everything that you need to get an A. TAKE HER!!!! :)"
3121,poor,Hw looks like Bill Gates. He is hard. Dont take the class.
3742,good,"Her lecture was easy, but the lab is so annoying. But if you take care of the exams, it would be easy A. And also, lots of extra credits chances for visiting museums and so on."
662,good,This was the toughest class I have taken so far. If your not 100% comfortable with the day and time with this teacher then don't take this course. Nod off in this guys class and he'll pop off. Gives an ok review for tests and encourages students to visit him during O.H. if you need help. Do the reading because this guy pop quizzes like a wizard.
4366,poor,"First day of class went off on tangent when discussing syllabus.  Hardly finished the syllabus before class was over.  Couldn't follow lecture, either.  The man was all over the place and the tests were just the same."
2085,good,"amusing, makes class fun and interesting at times"
3125,good,His final was impossible
4153,average,Just finished his final yesterday which is EXACTLY like the midterm except for about 10 different identification questions. Also gives the option to do 4 out of 6 short answers and 1 out of 5 essays. As long as you do the work you're ok. Go to class!
2345,poor,The whole class is self-promotion and quoting from the textbooks (that HE wrote)
2676,good,"excellent lecturer, fair marks"
4345,poor,"This professor is extremely boring, all he does is lecture.  His reviews are pointless, and his exams are hard.  DOES NOT FOLLOW SYLLABUS AT ALL!!  He says if you come to class you will do fine but really just read the book. Alot of material you need to read the book to know.  Horrible professor."
1420,good,"makes the class very interesting, made me want to minor in psychology, highly reccomend taking her class!"
2603,poor,Not a very good professor overall.... Does not respond well when questions are asked and just does not have a passion to teach the course....and she has this pretty irritating voice....
1553,poor,"Very boring class, you feel like you are really not learning anything. Not recomended"
942,good,"She is great! One of my favorite professors I have taken (and I'm a senior). She makes Sociology personal, and that makes the class very interesting. She really cares about her students, and will help you in any way she can to get the best grade possible."
2669,poor,No Comments
779,poor,"He is by FAR the WORST professor in UMASS. His lectures are very unorganized, so it's hard to take notes in class. He has no information about the class posted on his site. He is not clear in his lectures. If it wasn't a required course, I would avoid him."
1988,good,She is an good teacher! Bio 106 is such an easy class because you can get the notes at the annex and there's no need to even go to class if you read them although honestly I wanted to go to class because she makes it so interesting and funny.  She uses demonstrations and jokes around to make the class material enjoyable.  DEF TAKE THIS CLASS!!!
2623,good,"She is much better in this class than in mgt120. Explains everything perfectly, and always encourages questions. take her for mgt223 if you get the chance."
4184,poor,I?m disappointed with Mason and the quality of professors they have. Class is bad as well as the professor and lab instructors that have no idea what are they talking about. Tests are meant for challenging and failing the students and generate a source of revenue to the school. This is by far the worst class I?ve taken since I started Mason.
2663,poor,annoying voice & poor teaching skill
3596,average,"Sit near-ish the front, print out the power points, and you'll be fine."
121,good,"Dr. Alexander is very eccentric. His lectures are full of tangents, jokes, and even singing. Don't let that dissuade you, he is a fantastic professor. The online notes he provides are so detailed you could pass the class just by studying them, but I attended every lecture because I enjoyed them so much. He is very knowledgeable too."
887,good,he actually explains what he means
4215,good,"Not a bad professor,"
685,good,"SHE IS AMAZING! She makes sure you know everything about anything before you have to write the huge research paper. It was not bad at all! Very fun, relaxed class but we learned at the same time. Thanks to her, I know how to correctly write a research paper. She is a breath of fresh air compared to the more lecture-happy professors on this campus."
3560,average,Very difficult professor. I took IB biology in high school before taking cell bio. On the first day she said there is a 33% failure rate. I got a D and had to repeat the class and that destroyed my college school for the next 4 years.
1844,good,WHITBOURNE ROCKS!! Definitely take a class with her! If you try there is NO WAY you can fail this class. Lectures are interesting and she knows how to keep the class awake even at 9am! She's a great teacher and gives soo many opportunities for every1 to pass! take a class with her!
4155,poor,"Extremely hard. Very intimidating. Not recommended however, right now he's the only one that teaches IT 221. Go to every class and keep up with your homework. Good luck."
2457,good,I think that he was good but his tests were really hard! Chm in general is not that generous with marks!
413,good,"hi molumby,i know your reading this right now.  prof. molumby is well organized with fun lectures,but he talks too fast.you need to slow down a bit when you go on with lecture prof. his exams are a bit difficult and need to make sure to read the book because the exams cover book material.c u in clas"
789,poor,Prof is a nice guy but he shouldn't be teaching. His teaching style is random and he does a horrible job of actually explaining the material. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND DROP THIS CLASS ASAP OR ELSE YOUR GONNA SUFFER THROUGH THE SEMESTER
3942,good,"Um, wow&#63; Whoever said &quot;Greatest Professor at Mason&quot; wasn't joking. She makes boring material look interesting and is EXTREMELY dedicated to being a fantastic teacher. The book is useless; don't buy it. 3 tests and writing assignments. Attendance is mandatory and you're graded on it, but why would you miss this class&#63; It's fantastic!"
3521,good,She was is and will be the BEST professor so far!! I LOVE HER SO MUCH. Honestly she made bio so easy and explained stuff so well! If you are confused on anything just go to her office and you'l LOVE HER!!!
2037,good,"although this was a horrible class, it was split between 3 prof's, and Goodenough did a section! She is a good teacher, very clear, exams were a little tricky, but overall, pretty easy!"
2986,good,He was the best!
3632,good,"I thought this class was easy. She is definitely energetic but lectures are still boring. I rarely went to lecture and still got an A. Her tests are easy, best way to study is by looking at the power points and reading the chapters. Other than the tests there are no assignments (except in lab). I would recommend taking her."
1688,poor,it was god poor. Hes so old he broke his hip and we got an actually decent teacher. everyones grades jumped up until he came back and they all plummeted. he should stop teaching hes older than the dust in the air.
2817,poor,Easy to get full mark if you memorize. But you cannot learn anything from him. Take sta347 in summer to avoid this ass.
1425,good,"Tammy's good - Make sure you keep up with the readings and the class is a breeze. She's really funny and randomly gives extra credit points in class, so make sure you go! I highly recommend this class!"
2535,good,"kewl prof, cute,talks alot (good tho), interesting,best prof i had in chem"
272,average,"The class seems good UNTIL... you have to take his tests!! They are so tricky. The best way to prepare yourself is studying off old exams and attempting to memorize all 100+ power point slides, literally. I don't suggest waiting until the night before to study for his tests. you'll drive yourself crazy and be overwhelmed with information."
782,good,I only went to class for the first two weeks of the semester and still got an A. Just do the homework and go to the review sessions before tests. Don't bother buying the book because the Wiley access code you need for the homework comes with an ebook.
521,good,hes a really cool teacher
522,good,"i liked him a lot but the course was really boring... also the tests are insane and you realllly need to study.  He didn't give us any extra credit options, but i liked him anyway"
2377,average,His midterms were purely brutal. His examples were way to easy compared to the midterms he wrote. Plus he wasn't great at teaching nor was his powerpoint slides very helpful:T
2341,average,The course and the lectures are really interesting but the testing method sucks!
3571,good,"Class can be boring if bio isn't your thing. She was very energetic/enthusiastic which helped make the info more interesting. Exams/material are hard; however she gives VERY detailed study guides -- your grade is up to you. Notes are online, don't need the book, and she does review sessions before exams. Enjoyed her class and got an A!"
4166,poor,Took this course in summer session online. I feel like I was doing work for 2 courses. All her exams are now short answers. A LOT of reading and listening to her monotone PowerPoint.
350,good,He is a good prof. It's so interesting and he is so funny. I'm not afraid to ask him questions!
2168,good,Amazing prof!! makes the subject matter interesting and easy to understand!!
1995,good,She is so nice. Her class is easy. She gives extra credit. Read over your notes and you'll pass the test.
2765,poor,Materials were not clearly explained in lectures. Not willing to answer question
3681,good,She is an excellent teacher. I reccomend her. I took 103 and 104 with her and got A's in both of them. Take her..shez good
3980,good,"Loved her lectures - seamless. She takes great pride in her job and it shows. Comprehensive study guides and papers - which she is willing to read in advance and give feedback for improvement. Loved it, loved it, loved it."
1511,poor,Terrable class. Teach just writes down everything he says and confuses the hell out of you
651,good,"Mr. Everett is very boring but I did learn from his class.  Make sure you do the readings, as his tests cover the reading material.  Make sure you're well-rested before you come to class, because it's the typical lecture and you might fall asleep otherwise.  Study, study, study for the tests and do well on the research paper and you'll be fine."
3757,good,"Okay, this class is easy BUT it is A LOT OF WORK IM TALKING LIKE THE LAB IS 4 HOURS PLUS ANOTHER HOUR OF HW EVERY WEEK. The tests arent bad but lets put it this way, I got an A in other business courses (Accounting, MKT AND ETC.) but got a C in this course. If you are just trying to get a gen ed out of the way that is not a lot of work, avoid."
3500,poor,Thick accent and very difficult tests for a 100-level class. You'd better do well in the lab and on the homework if you want to pass this one.
3158,poor,"This is a self taught class, I repeat SELF TAUGHT! Going to class is honestly useless she doesn't teach, she rambles. You have to invest a lot of time and energy! The tests are really hard. Study the hws and quizzes like your depends on it, the tests are based on that. And don't expect any extra credit or curving from her."
4086,poor,"I emailed this guy to ask a simple question about IT policy at Mason and he replied in a way that made me feel like an idiot for even asking. Not helpful, not smart and if I met this guy on the streets jeez, you know the rest."
4243,good,"Her class is extremely clear and organized. The material is not difficult to grasp at all. If you just read the chapters and look at the slides, you should do really well. No surprises. Exams are relatively easy."
3309,poor,"Absolutely no reason to take 361 with this beeeeee-otch...take it with Karen if possible/with Baker if no other options.  361 is a tough class, why hate the class AND the teacher when you don't have to&#63;&#63;&#63;"
118,good,good lecturer who knows his stuff.  Funny guy too!
2579,poor,"Very bad teacher. She doesn't teach accounting, she reads accounting. If you have taken accounting in high school, just skip her lectures, they are useless; just read the text."
2351,good,"Prof. Browning has really made his lectures amusing. He is quite funny, and his animations are top shelf. Outside of classroom, Pro. Browning is extremely approachable and easygoing. Some say that his tests are hard; First, it isn't very hard and second, he's very willing to help with any questions you have, even dumb questions. XD"
168,poor,"you don't get your grades until the end of the semester. The tests are not based on the powerpoints, and he goes on rants during lectures."
2757,poor,the reason why life sci students are bitter.
1613,poor,the person above somed it up.....ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh poor teacher
835,poor,"Extremely unclear, never gives example problems. The material is not too hard but he makes it very confusing. He's not a bad guy, but his class is very boring and going is a waste of time. He may know what he's talking about, but no one else does. Help sessions w/ the TA's will save you though...but I would avoid him if possible."
1405,good,Loved her!
3119,good,"Great teacher, however class is exceptionally hard.  I did more work for these 3 units (mini course) than i have all year in my calc class."
4161,good,"One of the best professors I have had so far in the MBA program. Although she spends a bit more class time in group discussion than I prefer, you can tell that she is actually very prepared for class each week. If youre a decent writer, the class is pretty easy. Attendance is a big part of the 20% participation score, so come and dont leave early."
962,good,"Professor Schurter is by far the best professor I've had at UMass. I hate writing, but Schurter made this class enjoyable and inspirational. I learned more useful and relevant information and skills than I have from any other professor at UMass. If you can, make space in your schedule for this class over any other professor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. "
945,good,Best online teacher ever. very organized course and easy to navigate. Take this professor! She needs to give a class on teaching to other professors in the world.
462,good,"I loved his class! Dr. Capelotti is now one of my favorite professors. His personality makes the class enjoyable, and he made it easy for me to take an interest and really pay attention to the material. This class requires that you study and learn the material outside of class, but that should be required on a college level. His class rocked!"
2284,average,"BORING, he barks at students (cellphones) he's rude and against us mark wise"
328,average,"This guy can teach! The class is a challenge...but a sweet one. If you actually study and seek help when you do not understand something, you will excel. His lectures are the best on campus so far me.Get ready for evolution and truely being able to apply what you learn when you finish this class. Great spring board for genetics and bio curriculum."
3679,good,She was a good teacher who definitely knows her biology....the tests were kinda hard....but if you go to class and take notes you should be fine.
3739,good,"love love love her!!  she's such a great, amazing, nice person :-)  the material isn't hard and you don't need the book.  just fill out the learning guides during class and you'll do well.  the labs are kinda fun.  she tells hilarious stories in class.  take it in the summer!!!"
2462,good,"The most energetic and enthusiastic professor in U or T!!! Made me emjoy organic chemistry even MORE! His test this year, as other people put it, was tough with a 54 class average, but I did well and I found it to be very straightforward."
2247,good,"I switched my sociology class to be in Professor Brym's class. I think he's an excellent professor, and really makes the Con Hall experience worthwhile. He is very organized.. and this shows up in my note-taking as well."
3214,average,"The class wasn't that hard, but you really have to study. I think study on your own is the best to learn it."
1360,good,"Very good teacher, lots of extra points so very easy to get an A. If your average exam grade happens to be an 80 but u do all OWLs, in-class assignments, experiments and inclass bonuses, you will get an A!"
2223,poor,No Comments
367,good,one of my favorite teachers..kept class interesting..have to go to lectures for the test..but thats not a bad thing :)..knows his bees
4096,poor,"this prof. ignores u when u need help! He will make u feel stupid when you ask a question. He will try to fail you!His tests and quizzes are easy yet he barely gives u any credit because he does not believe in his students  passing and doing well, you are lucky if you get a D or a C.. Please don't take him unless u want to ruin part of ur life"
2416,good,"Very good prof. Clear, helpful, and genuinely cares about his students doing well."
3362,good,she is not bad at all.
4347,poor,"going to class is such a waste of time..looking around, almost everyone who's there is actually sleeping. just read the book with the study guidelines, and you dont even have to go to class"
2191,good,"I think he was first-rate, indeed. I mean obviously the guy's intelligent because he WROTE THE BOOK on Sociology, literally! Good text, great lectures, and like someone else said, he explained things slowly to that we could fully understand the concepts. I suppose that's why he was a little tough on the tests! Good guy though :)"
2591,poor,I hated the class
1375,good,"great teacher, great examples, really makes sure you know the material"
2525,good,he's adorable
772,average,Goes on tangents every class and teaches for maybe half the class. Easy to get a good grade but bring entertainment.
1284,good,"Such a nice Prof, one of the best classes I have ever take. Drops your lowest test, lowest 2 quizes and a SWA. Readings are really easy and enjoyable. Tests are actually somewhat hard, but as long as you READ the book thoroughly and DO the study guide you will do fine. You can also get 20 pts extra credit from psych studies. Over all good Prof."
3003,good,He's Beyond Fair.
1514,poor,"guy plops his butt into a chair and writes long winded notes on an overhead all class long, the whole time speaking in this boring monotone. He writes out EVERYTHING he says as in &quot;next... we will be discussing... the use... of the derivative&quot;. I completely stopped going to his class, and now sit in on other lectures and use the book."
4171,poor,WORSE TEACHER EVER!!! I DON'T KNOW WHY GMU HAS TEACHERS LIKE HER&#63;&#63;&#63;AVOID IF YOU CAN!!!YOU WON'T LEARN ANYTHING BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T TEACH ANYTHING SHE HAS HER TA'S DO ALL HER LAME WORK... AND WHEN YOU ASK FOR HELP GUESS WHAT&#63;&#63;THEY DON'T CARE!!!
4209,good,"Professor Wolf is very clear and tells you exactly what you need to know for the exams ( but a decent amount comes from lab).  She could be more concise in the lectures sometimes, but it's bc she want everyone to understand the material.  She great if you have questions although you probably won't.  Lab is a must.  Prof. Wolf is excellent."
498,good,"Not too bad of a class. Wasn't interested in this class at first.  Dr. Capelotti seems intimidating at first, but he is a very nice and helpful man. Download notes from Angel, and you'll be okay."
1414,good,This teacher rocked. She was very helpful and clear and was always willing to explain stuff further. Her classes were packed with interesting information and she often played film clips to help you understand better. She was nominated for an award cause she rocks.
1234,good,Very hard class to teach...does very well considering
3563,poor,I studied enormously for her class but still got a D :( it is a total gpa killer you need to read meticulously and everything!!! and write down everything that she says as she JUMPS AROUND WITH HER HANDS FLYING!!!!!!
435,good,Very interested in helping students learn. Comes to class with a positive attitude everyday. Course material is very clear and grading is fair. Pushes students to think and dance fully every class. Always let the class know when they are doing fantastic :)
1674,good,"Such a great professor. Taught the material at good pace and kept the class laughing. Easy to understand teaching method. Incredibly nice and will go out of his way to help you, so long as you ask."
1251,good,"I LOVE TAMMY AND I LOVED THIS CLASS. Spontaneous writing assignments in class that you have to read for, short weekly quizzes for homework, offers TONS of extra credit, makes the class very interesting! Fairly easy exams, minimal effort required... she doesn't post her slides online so you have to go to class (but you'll want to go!)."
365,good,"I will forever be in awe of Dr. Molumby.  You are seriously missing out if you don't take his 101 course.  He is brilliant, helpful and it doesn't hurt that he shares his, in my opinion, obviously correct wordlview with the class.  Fours stars, two thumbs up, and all that.  PS-go to class and work hard."
1945,good,Bio 106 with Goodenough is an easy course. She provides the lecture notes as well as the powerpoint she uses for the whole semester on Moodle. There is homework once a week that takes at most 30 minutes. She is a very nice person and genuinely enjoys teaching the course.
3693,good,No Comments
276,average,"His tests are very tricky, watch out!!!"
3130,poor,"I feel the last reviewers. His lectures are very dry, and he doesn't seem to be able to explain the material well. He uses a ""textbook"" that he wrote which is horrible. Mid-term and final exams are based on only one single chapter, so luck is a significant factor. I'd recommend 15-317 instead, which is its alternative for most purposes."
2018,good,i advise everyong to take human bio with judy. she is a fanominal teacher and inceradible nice. she's amazing
2653,poor,"She's a horrendous professor and would not be able to teach a fish how to swim, let alone a bright student accounting concepts.  Her tests (especially M/C is extremely difficult and un-fair)"
3150,poor,No Comments
1506,poor,"just dont take this class with him. take anybody but him, i hear Calden is very good."
407,good,He's exams are very tricky.  Study the old exams and you will be better off.
3221,average,"Very challenging class. Accounting is already a hard subject and Hylton doesn't make it easier. Lectures never helped me. She flies through the material and thinks we know most of it before we start. Recitation helped a little bit, but the connect homework, connect quizzes and studying more than 15 hours for every exam got me a B."
1644,poor,"all he talks about is archimedes, galileo, isaac newton, and isaac barrow. does not teach the material and tests are completely different from what he talks about. this man should be ashamed of himself"
2230,poor,This class is Propaganda Central.
2069,good,"very funny, and straight forward."
1924,poor,No Comments
4370,average,I was only in his class for one day so i dunno if hes easy or not.I couldnt be in his class for the rest of the semester. he just jumped into the lecture without explaing just what we would do in the class and I didnt understand what he was talking about. Didnt strike me as an interesting guy.
2899,good,"people are complaining how his tests are too specific but how is that bad? His tests are literally word for word from the textbook, and YOU HAVE THE TEXTBOOK! basically you have the answers...so I dont understand how that is a huge ""problem"" for students. Plus, his lectures are interesting and follow the text nicely as well.Do your readings=85%+"
844,poor,He sucks!!! Don't take this course!!
3728,good,"Really nice lady, and over all a pretty good professor. Lectures can get a little boring sometimes. Make sure you show up because we do in-class electronic questions from time to time. Has some pretty gross stories, but its fun to listen if you have a strong stomach. Lab was horrible though, that's the only real downer about Largen."
2044,good,"From what I remember she was very easy, back in the late 90's, so long as you paid attention in class. She has a quirky sense of humor and is a total nerd.. she's good. Warning: she talks about certain activities with her husband. Whenever she can, really. It's weird."
86,good,attending CS106A online: Mehran Rocks!
3634,good,Had her for lab. Very energetic. Tries to make it understandable. A little gets lost in the accent but good teacher otherwise.
3979,good,great class. Make sure on your papers you pick apart what you are analyzing or else she will take off. She is very passionate about the subject which makes the class great.
3707,average,"Would be a good professor if she did not try to trick you with trick questions on quizzes. She asks a true or false question and has A. False and B. True. There is no point to this other than trying to trick the student! I don't get why any professor would do this. Additionally, in a 40 min test period she gives exams with 45 questions."
2238,poor,No Comments
4395,average,"I got an A in the class and never went to over 5 of the lectures.  That is because the material on the tests cme directly from the book, not what he taught in class. Just read the book"
1196,good,I love this man! He's good!
855,poor,"this class is insanely difficult b/c he goes over things way to fast, and fails to explain them unless you constantly ask.  It is good cuz no quizzes, which means you dont have to do if you dont want to.  Get a tutor and youll be allset."
1878,good,"Prof. Whitbourne is great! She uses lecture notes, his lectures are filled w/music, videos & power point slides. She is one of the best teachers I have ever had!!!"
2480,good,I have to agree with everyone elses comments about Prof. Browning...especialy the one about him unintentionally running his hands through his hair...lol...Excellent Professor!!
78,good,Mehran is a bright and interesting lecturer who keeps his audience in mind. My only criticism is his use of pet phrases (e.g. Rock On) which amuse at first but become tiresome by the 10th lecture.
944,good,"My favorite teacher and one of the coolest teachers at West Ga. I got an A out of the class. Come to class, take notes and read the book and you'll pass the class. I would take another one of her classes."
199,average,If you sit from the middle to the back of the lecture hall you won't hear a word he says. The powerpoints are FULL of text and very boring. Lab was also boring and kind of a waste of time. Interesting material if you read it. Tests are composed of material from powerpoints. Go through all slides and old exams to study.
3937,good,"I love, love, love her! I took art history 101 just for fun because of her. She is smart as a whip and sassy. Class is fun, but you learn ALOT. Mason better wake up and give her tenure before a wise school sweeps her away; robbing GMU of their best professor. She is so good I may take one of her classes after graduation. Oh, she's pretty cute too!"
3953,good,She is the best teacher at mason!!! actually makes art history FUN!!!  just take good notes in class and you shouldnt need to buy the book!!  (i didnt have one and i got an A)  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
801,poor,"Professor Cook is a terrible teacher, and an even worse comedian. The only thing worse than his lessons were his jokes. There was zero learning and zero laughter. I walked into the final exam touting an A average, and failed the exam, which landed me with a final grade of a C. This class was absolutely horrible, and you have no choice but this man."
2846,average,"He wasn't bad at all. We had 3 hours allotted for lecture, he let us go after 2. Marking scheme was good: do better on the next test, that's your course mark, so do the best on your exam, that's your final mark. A lot of memorizing though..."
3511,good,"INCREDIBLE PROFESSOR! Fondufe genuinely cares for her students and is hands down the most enthusiastic lecturer I have EVER had. Is an easy A? No. You will have to do more than memorize the power points the night before in order to get an A, but it's definitely not impossible! "
4219,good,"She really does try to make the lectures decent.  &quot;A&quot; for effort Ms. Wolfe, &quot;A&quot; for effort. But you know it's a lecture(BOOORING).  Study for the test.  Get a head start on the paper.  Go to lecture.  Don't break your egg."
2258,good,Helpful anytime I needed it. Updates course website frequently. Lectures are structured very well. Perhaps a list of the major points and objectives of the lecture at the beginning would be helpful. Excellent!
231,poor,"To be completely honest, this guy was very tough. Material not that hard, but the way it was tested, pretty tough indeed. Exam questions were pretty hard too. It wasn't about knowing the nature of certain biological concepts, rather, his last sentence on slide 256 of his 3rd powerpoint of the unit."
2005,good,"I loved her!! She is so cute and quirky. Her review sessions prior to exams were also a big help. She also gives extra credit in class, so go!!!"
2813,poor,No Comments
1033,good,"Randy really is a great teacher. His classes run very smoothly and he tries to make biology as fun and approachable to the students as possible. While his unwillingness to give away answers for any clicker questions and his sometimes vague responses of ""yeah, maybe"" could be frustrating, his methods will grow on you and i very highly recommend him."
3260,poor,This professor is a real shame for George Mason.
2634,good,this class wastes your time- her slides are stolen from the CD and she just reads off the slides every class- and her tests are so much harder than what she actually teaches
1583,poor,"Didn't teach me much, had to learn it on my own, but let's you use book and notes on tests that average 5 to 6 hours long cause you have unlimited time, which you end up using asking yourself, &quot;Where did this come from&#63;&quot;"
2665,good,"A more laid back teacher. Overall I liked her, but then I got 100%. People should remember that this is a course where u have to do most of the reading on their own.  They can't expect her to teach everything in the textbook in just 2 hours a week."
3971,good,Excellent teacher! She made the class fun and enjoyable. The lectures were very clear and she got you involved with the artwork she presented.
2337,good,"Explains concepts well, and the tests are generally pretty straightforward"
424,good,"Yummy.  He teaches some Animal Behavior classes at Columbia, and let's just say we're very happy to have him here."
392,average,Is a pretty good teacher.
1143,good,"He is really great at teaching. He really wants people to do well. The way he teaches is so interesting that i didn't need to read the book at all to do well. He always holds review sessions. He really wants people to understand the material and do well. Quizzes every friday, he drops them if he thinks they're unfair."
4163,average,"She is OK, but the class is horrible. I can't believe I had to waist my money on it. Most of the material is common sense and lectures are super boring. Exams are timed and could be challenging. I'm glad it's over."
191,good,"DECENT PROFESSOR. Study like crazy off the power points and practice exams if you want an a or b in his class. if not, you'll be grateful with a c."
104,good,Best Teacher I've Had At Stanford
3499,average,"This class was the death of me for a gen Ed. Fondufe loves biology and is super entergetic for reading PowerPoint slides. Honestly I barely went to class, read the notes or studied and somehow still passed. The test me are very difficult and confusing for an intro course. "
3899,good,BEST TEACHER AT MASON. Took it as an elective and I've never enjoyed a class so much. She is very passionate about what she teaches and also very funny! She makes architecture much more interesting =)
1964,good,Very informative class to fill a Gen-Ed!
2268,good,great prof!
553,poor,"Very arrogant man, which made him unapproachable for help. Screwed us for the final, had his favourites, and stuck his tongue out too dang much during lecture. SO happy when he left"
3829,poor,12/140 People show up to lecture... something wrong there.  Especially when you read of the lecture slides.
1948,good,"She is absolutely amazing! She's funny and manages to get everyone involved in the lectures, though there are 500 people. Great professor, easy class, would definitely reccommend! "
1459,poor,Terrible Teacher. Decides to teach the last section first just for fun. The only way to keep afloat in this class is to attend another class with a real teacher. The only helpful thing he does is let you use your notes on the tests
1756,average,"took calc in high school, and never went/ go to class and got an A in 127 and will get one in 128... boring class, puts me to sleep, and doesnt explain things well, so i dont go.  tests to the point usually."
2529,good,beyond good
2639,poor,just terrible.....
2179,poor,No Comments
2107,good,Multiple choice exams can be tricky but study and understand the textbook material and you'll be fine. Brym explains things well.
1787,good,"If you do the work, you'll be fine! Take advantage of the extra credit and go to class as long as you can. I missed some Friday classes and had no problem. Use the study guide and lecture notes and you'll do well"
3609,good,She is an excellent professor. she teaches the material very well.She is energetic during class. she is very caring. Go to the review sessions before exams...very helpful.
1587,poor,"This was the worst math professor i've ever had. he was lazy, and didnt give examples in class. instead, he'd sit at an overhead projector and just write paragraphs, and expect us to decipher them. do not take this class with this teacher"
4005,good,"Lyons is a great guy, there's a lot of misconceptions about him. Follow his rules and you'll do fine. There are 2 exams, 1 assignment, and lots of in class hands-on work. Grading is very fair. In this class he teaches you the hands-on offensive/defensive techniques with VMs. Be in class and listen and you will do well."
1731,poor,"He spends entire classes deriving formulas that are in the text already, and spouting off about Leibniz and Newton. Hates cell phones, yet comes to class 10 minutes late EVERY time. Avoid this class at all costs, unless calculus comes easily to you- you will not learn anything!! Seriously, he sucks!"
3587,poor,This class was dreadful to me. I go to class everyday and couldnt get myself to pay attention. Her powerpoint slides made it hard for u to want to pay attention. I didnt even bother. Ah! i hated this class
4365,good,"This class is easy.  You don't even have to go to class, although I thought his lectures were alright, just read the chapters and go over the terms he gives you.  2 multiple choice tests and a final.  He's also really nice."
2884,average,"I took SOC102 and 103. Didn't buy the textbook for either (he assigns books he wrote every year); borrowed it from the library if I felt like going more in depth than what was on the slides. Good course if you like rote memorization. Went to all the lectures for 102, none for 103, only studied before tests, got 78 in both. Easy A with more effort."
3042,good,No Comments
1791,average,"If you are truly interested in taking/majoring psychology, then go right ahead and enroll. If you have no interest whatsoever (such as engineer major or filling in GE requirement), this class will be pretty difficult. I personally found it harder to score higher on her exams compared to those in my engineering major."
2344,good,"He does a great job conveying the material, plus he's a tom jones lookalike."
1940,good,"Professor Goodenough is one of the sweetest, most wonderful professor's I've had at UMass. She is literally the storybook grandmother that you wish you had, and just the cutest person in general. I really want to give her a hug whenever I see her. I took her Bio 288 class this semester and it was a breeze. Easy assignments, lots of extra credit."
702,average,She is very nice and very laidback! Most prof. require a 60 pg paper for this course but she just wants u to do a small paper and oral presentation. This professor is a bit unorganized but pay attention to her lectures because whatever she talks about will be on the exams. She will tell u exactly what is on it if you ask her.she lets u out early!
3417,good,She's not that bad. She does go fast but I'll take her over any other accounting teacher. Problem is some of the questions on the test are written differently than how she shows you but still not hard. Just study a chapter a day and you'll be fine.
2186,poor,No Comments
3988,good,"I dreaded taking a &quot;fine art&quot; at Mason. I dont like or understand art. But this is a great teacher who is fair, easy, and will get you to understand about art. After the 1st week or two this became my most interesting class. Very real and down to earth, not your stereotypical art teacher."
994,poor,Very condescending and rude if you ask for help outside of class. He expects you to have taken bio previously and fully understand the concepts. Only reason I passed was because I took AP Bio. Not very nice and not very helpful.
464,average,"Took him for 21 & 45. There are a lot of notes but the tests aren't hard if you study. Their multiple choice! 3 exams and a final that's it.  if you aren't a good test taker maybe this isn't the class for you. But that's what college is, tests. If you're in college and don't know how to take a test, maybe you should go to community."
2090,good,"His questions on tests are harder than caron's.  He's pretty interesting though, and I like his statistics and real life examples; in comparison with caron, who is much more definitionalby the book.  I think the two complement each other well.  Caron makes things cleareasier as a course coordinator; Brym's lectures are very goodinteresting."
3539,good,"She's easy enough if you go to class and do the study guides (and by that I mean actually do them, not flip through them at the last minute). You don't need the book, she puts her slides on blackboard, and not every iClicker quiz counts. The most annoying thing is the online assignments, which she only announces in class."
3799,average,No Comments
4193,good,Go Mason for giving the online lecture option! Web class was fine & Prof is great. Read the slides & go to lab for an easy A in this class. The paper is graded a little harsh but lots of extra credit available to make it up. There were a few exam Q's only in txt book otherwise book not needed too much.
2707,poor,don't ever take his lecture course!!! boring :((
1236,good,Profesor Rahhal is really great. Her lecture slides are very easy to follow and she does a good job explaining things. There is homework and some pop quizzes but she gives a ton of extra credit and drops your lowest exam score. She is highly recommended.
3703,good,"The best science teacher I have ever had. Her lectures are very clear, she has great relationships with the students and labs aren't terribly hard, just long. Gives 3 tests that are entirely based on her lectures and powerpoints. Professor Largen is also always willing to help and explain difficult concepts, don't be afraid to ask her."
2533,good,he was my favourite teacher.  I actually paid attention in his lectures
212,good,Class was very hard but final wasnt bad and amazing curve. Deff take him
1036,average,"I disliked him at first due to how he jumped straight into deep material on the first day of class, but afterwards I got used to his concept teaching style and was able to pull through. His exams are tough, no doubt, and you better be prepared for a quiz every Friday but most times he's pretty lenient with letting us use notes or discuss it "
4324,poor,"Very nice and sweet. I did not like his teaching method. But everything was out of the book so i still did well. As I said before, he is very nice but I would not recommend him if you are actually trying to learn something"
900,good,"AMAZING! I look forward to going to her class. She relates all of our sections with her past life experiences. I love how she gives you the freedom to express yourself and she isn't bias to any opinion. Truly a well-rounded teacher. I highly recommend taking her class! Take notes though, PLEASE. It'll help when it's time for test."
1446,poor,"He is a nice guy, but he's usually late to class. His lecture didn't help me at all. You have to teach yourself. Midterms were poor... I guess he's really smart so he can't understand what and why are we confused about."
4109,poor,"He is one of the most difficult professors.  For a first level graduate course, he spent a majority of his time tried to make the topic as difficult as possible.  As a working adult paying for the course out of pocket, I found his style better suited to elementary school."
1849,poor,"WAYYY overrated. Bubbly in class, but wont give you the time of day otherwise. Thinks she is better than everyone else. Easy A, but not worth it. Take PSYCH 100 with someone who will actually help you if you need it."
2159,good,"WONDERFUL CLASS AND YOU NEVER FEEL HIS BIG CLASSES, VERY PASSIONATE, CAREFUL PROF ABOUT THE STUDENTS,I learned many life lessons from his class, exteremely punctual, organized, kind prof, extermely well presentor, very helpful for ESL students, don't miss his classes I wish I had more classes with him"
2197,good,"Dr. Brym is a wonderful prof. He is very interested in his field and gives great lectures. It is very possible to get good grades in his class if you spend sometime studying sociology everyday. If you leave the readings till just before a test, you will either fail or get a bad mark. The tests are a little challenging, but not unfair by any means."
660,good,This class isn't that bad.  But it's definately not for someone looking for an easy A. This class is challenging and you have to make sure you do all the work otherwise you will not pass.
1614,good,No Comments
741,poor,Cook has been at it a long time and is the definition of old school teaching. I was never great at Calculus so i went to 95% of lectures and still had a lot of trouble with the materiel. Effort outside the class is a necessity to get a good grade. 
245,poor,"he think he is darwin or sth,,,clearly he is just focusing on lecture.. he is not willing to help you outside of class for example, not answering email question, during office visit told student look up wikipedia with question... what a good bio professor i would try avoid his class his test is tricky too"
3661,average,"I must say, Fondufe's class is good if you A) already know Biology and just need to finish the course or B) enjoy being read to from a textbook.  Personally I need an instructor who does a little more than a daily &quot;story time.&quot;  Sum it up: Boring as all!"
1754,poor,"His tests are more clear than Math 127 tests, kind of a funny teacher, but makes me sleepy."
2029,good,"She was part of three teachers that teach the class. She is a small woman, sooo funny. Offers extra credit, test was straight forward. Lectures were entertaining. Puts all lectures, powerpoint slides, and notes online. Just study before the exam and you will do fine. Her classes are funny and entertaining they make you want to go. good woman!"
3161,poor,Extremely difficult class to pass especially with Hylton. She's very rude and talks very fast during lecture. I asked her to repeat something because she spoke too fast and didn't hear what she said and refused to repeat herself. Some professors don't care about the success of their students and hylton is one them. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
1206,good,"Hands down the best professor I have had in my 4 years at UMass. Runs help sessions 2 times a week on his own time, gives clearest exams I have taken so far and shows the most genuine interest in his students' learning that I have seen."
509,good,"A little weird at first, but interesting nonetheless.  Class is pretty easy if you read the materials and study.  Good teacher overall."
3378,good,She tells you exactly what will be on exams and is clear when explaining the material.  Always willing to help and wants you to succeed.  A great professor!
597,good,"Great class, though there were a lot of whiny, entitled students in the class.  If you argue that Robert Wilson killed Francis Macomber when the omniscient narrator clearly states it was Margot that did it, Everett is going to let you know.  He will do that with any interpretation of literature.  You have to be persuasive!  It is college!"
2178,average,his tests are deadly
3514,good,She loves biology and she is helpful. BUT HER EXAM ARE HARD and very tricky :)  You dont need a book everything comes from the slides and her exam questions are developed to confuse you . Not an Easy A . I wished that I took it with Madden :(  
4271,average,The test is not to be as long you do the reading.  The only problem I have is trying to read the stupid book...They need to get a better textbook....
981,good,All the tests & Friday quizzes are multiple true/false & the discussion assignments are T/F & free response so you have to be able to understand concepts and ideas to do well in his class - not just facts. He goes pretty fast so use a laptop or record it. If you pay attention and go to all SI sessions it's an easy B and a kind of difficult A.
3002,good,teaches in a very interesting way
4130,good,"Great instructor, but lots of work.  Homework is long, project is unbelievably timeconsuming. Not hard, just takes a lot of time.  But he really, really knows his stuff.  I learned a lot, but be prepared to put in a lot of time.  I'd take him again."
518,good,As long as you read the ANGEL notes you'll be okay.
3306,average,"There are a lot of information you have to know, we covered just about the whole book. The teacher overall is very energetic and loud. She's not a bad teacher but there is just so much she has to cover so read the chapters. Each exam has atleat 3 chapters. Good Luck."
767,good,A good professor who has good intentions. His age does make it a little harder to understand but he knows his stuff and if you aren't retarded you will do fine.
4287,average,"He was there for you if you asked for help and would give out extra credit. His quizzes are pretty easy, but for some reason his exams weren't. I barely showed up for class. Just do his study guides and read the chapters and you will be fine! "
1726,poor,"He is the worst teacher i have ever had. I love math, and i normally understand the concepts in math very well, but he just doesn't know how to teach. he doesn't show you how to apply anything, and what he does teach he teaches in the most round about and confusing way possible. do anything to avoid having him!!"
1651,average,"Confused why everyone is talking about how he makes exams hard.. he doesn't even write the exams, the department does. He even admitted he thought the exam was too hard so he would scale the final grades for our class. caring and knows his stuff, calc can be confusing, not his fault. I skip class at least 2 out of 3 times a week, still manage an A."
2902,average,"Condescending, arrogant, and overall just plain rude. The tests are too specific; some questions are drawn from statistics hidden in the most obscure graphs, which are shown only for a few seconds in lecture. Too much readings for a half year course, and the readings use sociological jargons that was never taught. Overall, don't take this course."
3127,good,No Comments
3641,good,She's very entertaining because she likes to jump around a lot.  She's very nice and helpful.  If you read the book before she does the lecture you will definitely do well on her exams.  She uses many analogies to explain the concepts. She gets the questions on her exams from the old exams and from the end of each chapter.
3265,poor,"It's a simple formula to get through this class: 1) Nerves of steel    2) The ability to teach yourself thoroughly     3)Preparation for the worst teacher of your life       It's a piece of cake if you can do all those things. Oh yeah, be prepared for point deduction, don't even bother asking why because you won't get a respectable response anyway."
421,good,"OUTSTANDING class!  His tests are tough, but he gives you the information - just study.  Can learn a lot in this class"
123,good,"Probably the best teacher i've had since i've been at state. He presents the material in a very interesting way and has some hilarious stories to go along. His classes are usualy not easy, but that's the nature of the course and not his fault."
3263,poor,"Avoid this professor if you:1. dont like to be called during the class (she calls up your name to ask questions if you dont answer, she make you embarrassed) 2. foreigner (she discriminateS students based on their first language)OVERALL, she is the worst professor I have had She does not teach but yell every time in front of you"
4346,poor,i wrote this professor 5 emails and he never responded to any of them. he is unreachable
1244,good,"Amazing professor do the small books readings textbook not necessary but helpful, she gives mini quizzes on readings and if you come to class after an exam expect extra credit, she drops one exam super helpful. Tas helpful as well, would take again"
819,poor,"poor, poor teacher. He just puts random examples on the board, solves them himself and doesn't explain how or when to use the equation. Math was always fun and enjoyable for me until this guy. Very unhelpful. Doesn't look at emails. Just don't take 127 with him."
1403,good,"tammy is the BEST, she's hilarious, soo smart, very interesting... 4 exams, drops the lowest... no final, the owls are annoying but easy, offers lots of extra credit!"
1382,good,"One of the best teachers I have ever encountered in my life.  Made everything she talked about seem exciting, and told lots of funny stories.  On a side note, the class is pretty easy (and if you do well in the first 3/4 of the class, you dont have to do the rest of it, because of dropping grades), and she's hot."
100,good,Good teacher
4126,good,"He knows his stuff really well.  You must go to all classes and do the homework.  He is clear on what he wants, but he hates slackers.  If you slack or skip class, don't take it.  Homework is time consuming, and the project is unbelievably time consuming.  Be ready to do lots of work."
1575,poor,slept through class more than I went to it...so boring but an 85 is an A so i cant really complain
1638,good,"If you don't mind getting into the actual theory behind basic calculus, Cook is great. He's an older guy, and an old-fashioned lecturer, but I find it charming and refreshing. The exams are easy if you know how to make good use of your calculator, attend class, and follow the text somewhat. I don't know why people are so down on him..."
1795,average,Super nice. Not helpful at all. What she lectures is rarely on test. GET LEARNSMART
4237,good,"Her exams are semi-hard, you need to attend class. Her notes are the main key to her exams. Going to lab is helpful b/c of all the quizes given. Do the extra credit, it boosts your grade by a full letter!"
399,good,It was a great class all around. The professor was good and my TA was the best one I have met at UIC.
3731,good,Do not buy the textbook for the lecture! It wont help you. marginal cost clearly exceeds marginal benefit. the course material is simple. just take the time to go over the power points and study before the exams. Dr. Largen is a sweet person and wants her students to succeed. Recommended.
3782,good,"Really easy class. I thought the exams were pretty simple as long as you use the study guide. I never opened the book (in fact, I never bought it) and got an A in the class. The class can sometimes be a bit boring, but she's really sweet and it's really easy."
3873,good,"She is a very good professor, would recommend her. Classes are fun but you have to do the reading because she gives pop quizzes. nothing hard. Just read before class, attend class, study from the study guide she provides and you'll get an A."
1352,good,"Amazingggg, take this class, you'll actually want to go to it."
4342,poor,teacher SUCKS! hes boring as sh!+ and the lectures are pointless. never take him and switch your major if its sociology
3924,good,"This is a hard class! dont think its an easy A, at all!! I found her to be interesting, but the exams are no joke. Go to every class, and write down everything. I mean everything. If you like art, you will enjoy, if not, look else where. She is tough."
982,average,"I had to really work in this class to get the grade I wanted. His exams are difficult with trick questions, so it is easy to get a few wrong. I had to study a ton in this class. I think Randy does care about his students, and even proposed a new grading system, but he definitely makes this intro class very difficult. You also don't need the book."
456,poor,"Well I will start off by saying by the end of the semester more then half of the class will drop this class. test are very hard and not based on the notes given in class or the book. you pretty much have to teach yourself everything. he is not too helpful if you are struggling, he will just suggest you to drop the course... I would not refer."
2748,poor,that a prof this rotten should be teaching such a core course is a disgrace!
3509,good,Prof Fondufe is one of the best professors as Mason in my opinion. She is very passionate about biology and you can tell by her lectures. Your grade will reflect the amount of studying you put in. Everything you need to know are on her powerpoints so buying the book would be a waste. Genuinely love her.
1950,good,"Really easy class if you show up, do the homeworks, and study a bit before the exams. I'm not a science person AT ALL and still managed a 95 average in this class. The concepts you learn are actually really interesting and apply to everyday life and your overall health. Great professor!"
3497,good,"She was a wonderful lab instructor, energetic even at 7:30 in the morning! Her lectures were never boring and I honestly learned just as much if not more from her lab class than my bio lecture!  "
4169,good,"Took the online course with her, class was super easy. Exams were straight from the online powerpoints. Online lectures were only about 1 hour per week (much shorter than a physical class). The exams were multiple choice and very easy!"
641,good,"Mr. Everett is a very good teacher. In my opinion, he is too easy for a college professor. But I'm not complaining. He lays everything out in the handbooks and the syllabus which helps a lot. Yes, there is a lot of writing, but its well worth it. If you just do the work on time, you'll pass."
1953,good,"I recommend her for junior year writing. It was pretty easy, a few writing assignments each week but they were not difficult. One major project that accounts for 50% of your grade, so just do well on that and you'll get an A"
4028,good,He gives you everything you need to get an A. If you are a good student it's a easy class. I don't know what all this crying is about.
3405,good,Challenging professor but she definitely gets you to learn the material well. Read the book and do the practice problems. The study guide book helps a lot for the exams as well.
4195,good,"I took the online lecture with her and it wasn't  bad at all. The second exam was a little tricky, but other than that, read the text book, read the slides once to yourself and then listen to the lecture. Material made more sense to me this way. I studied slides and terms for exams and got an A in the class. The paper wasn't too bad either."
3534,good,Reads directly off powerpoints.  If you want an A read the chapter and skim the powerpoint before she goes over it.  Her lecture is just reading directly off the powerpoint.  Exams are very tricky; average is ~65% - no curves but sometimes gives a 2% or 4% boost on each exam.  Impossible to get an A! If you want an A; dont take her!!
1884,good,No Comments
3699,good,"Professor Largen is such a sweet lady! In my Environmental Science class I didn't get to meet her on a personal level, but she was so willing to help the class with whatever questions we had, and also was so understanding when we had trouble with our TopHat (online questions during lecture). This class is THE BEST for a lab requirement. TAKE IT!"
3176,poor,She is so rude! Worst professor not helpful at all.  Ruined my first semester. AVIOD taking her.
2244,poor,"after 2 horrible, stupid tests, i absolutely hate this course. the textbook, which Brym wrote himself, is horribly unclear and unbelievable boring. trying to read it is tedious in itself.  listening to his equally unclear lectures is also a pain in da ass"
845,average,extremely boring. I went to only 3 classes but still did fine.
542,average,"Tough class.  Quizzes everyday!  She is a neat lady, but not a fun teacher."
91,good,"I am a computer science student, but do not attend Stanford University. I have seen most of his online lectures on programming methodology and i have been blown away. By far the best professor/instructor/teacher/lecturer i have EVER seen in front of a class doing what they do best."
3172,poor,"You have to teach yourself everything to be honest. She doesn't really go over things in class and if you have questions, she answers them very matter-of-factly as if Accounting comes naturally to you. Spent all semester doing computational problems in class only for the final exam to be conceptually based. GMU's school of business is a mess."
1979,good,No need to go to class. Buy the study guide for like 8 bucks and study that before exams and you'll do fine.
2185,poor,"Not a good professor. The multiple choice tests focus on minor detail and do not effectively test a students knowledge. The lectures were not engaging, the professor loses focus easily, the use of TA's was non existent and the prof was not really approchable. Alot of people failed by a marginal percentage."
3164,good,"One of the best professors I have had at Mason so far. If you follow her lectures along with the chapters in the book, you will be absolutely fine. Online homework really solidifies the chapters so if you stay on top of your work you'll get a good grade! Her final was really tricky and she focused mainly on the final chapters she taught, good luck!"
2251,good,"Prof. Brym is a great teacher, but what he says in class, you could highlight in your book and take little notes on the side for his &quot;in class&quot; questions on mid-terms.  Loved the course, though."
4306,poor,"His lectures had nothing to do with the class, my roommate and I only went to class on days there was a test and still passed."
1048,good,"His class was definitely a challenge at first because he mainly only uses diagrams and true/false questions on his exams. But, by the second month, it turned into one of my favorite classes because his teaching style started to make sense and the class seemed easier. You should attend every class, and he gives weekly, easy Friday quizzes."
1960,good,She is the best! So funny and she does the best demonstrations. Great class.
237,poor,"RUN & DON'T LOOK BACK! Hands down, one of the worst professors I've had in my college career & I wanted so badly to like him.  I am not trying to slam the man but I'm just being honest.  He gets off on tricking his students...WE GET IT MOLUMBY, YOU'RE THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE ROOM, SO ENOUGH WITH THE GAMES AND JUST TEACH US!"
2297,average,"personally, i think hes funny and very knowledgeable... kind of  im right  but.."
1133,good,"good guy, class time usually flies by. lots of PRS use to help get points across and definitely keeps students involved. holds lots of review sessions and makes them interesting (talent nights). nothing to complain about except the labs :-X"
1805,good,She's really easy and entertaining. Her notes are fill in the blank and if you miss class you can easily copy them from someone else.
3231,average,"I took this online in 4 weeks for my Business Minor. I spent 4-5 hours a day studying and was really discouraged after I got a D on my midterm. However, she said the final would be counted more if you did well. I ended up with a B. I taught myself a lot and relied on the book. Her ""online lectures"" were useless. Great class, ok professor."
163,poor,He's arrogant. Tests are impossible and ask ridiculous trivial nonsensical questions. Second test was a group test yet I don't know a group who got a 100 (Though most groups got B's and A's). Doesn't know how to teach or how to run a class. Would avoid him as much as possible.
3114,good,He is an AMAZING teacher! I had such a hard time in Calc I but with him Calc II was so easy. He is totally open to you coming in for help and he is a really personable guy and loves helping and teaching. One of my favorite prof. by far
2602,poor,"SHE MAKES ME HATE ACCOUNTING FOREVER. Seriously, she looks like she rather stays at home than in class."
2686,poor,No Comments
2483,good,He is good!
2828,poor,errrrrrrrrrrrr i hate him... he is so rude and makes me want to kill myself...the course was hard and he made it worse
3201,good,"Hylton is tough, but is one of the best professors Ive had in college so far, IMO. If u GO to class prepared and put the time into studying, you'll do very well. Use Connect (Learnsmart; homework didn't help me that much) to learnstudy the material, specifically in preparation for the test and you'll do very well. You MUST study for the test.   "
1811,good,"Super easy class as long as you do the work. Follow her on twitter, she posts review points that are usually on the test! Always study review points in general, thats where the exam questions come from."
2411,good,decent prof last year i had him and his test wasn't that hard...hope he continues this year :)
3528,good,"This class is going to be a little difficult. You will definitely need to put some effort in if you want to get a good, solid A. Study the power points well! The book was never really useful or helpful to me. If you study a lot and really know the material backwards and forwards than a A should be NO PROBLEM."
3759,good,"Even if this is a high rating, let me tell you, this class is only for those who want to get the science gen ed out of the way. This class is far too easy, and some of the stuff she teaches is what you have learned in high school. It really helps that she has study guides for you. Absolutely hate the labs, for the workload is completely ridiculous."
2997,good,"Amazing Prof! very inspirational. I am sure he has changed thousands of lives for better. People who think he is unorganized, and unclear, are the ones who don't wanna go to lectures. But if you go to lectures, this is the best course ever. He is a special prof, very different... a prof you will remember for the rest of your life --&gt; the BEST!"
2638,poor,"I don't even see why she is in the room, the whole class she just sits there and listen to students present.  And when she actually gives a lecture, it's less than 15 mins and she reads off the slides that we printed off the site already.  Absolutely useless, overloads of assignments, learn nothing"
4397,poor,Just blabbers on.  Very hard to understand.  Study guides do not help on exam.  Must atten lectures to knows what goes on the exam.
4083,average,I only took this class because I had too. The grading was ridiculous. I think the HW requirements were extreme. And I think its ridiculous to cite the origins of the APA format.
2293,average,100% multi. coice tests - always against the student!
1452,poor,"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! He acts like you are a brilliant mathematician that knows everything at calculus. He stands in front of the work he does on the board so you can't see until he moves onto another problem. He has no clue what is going on, ever. The only way I'm passing right now is because i went to the midterm reviews and tutoring sessions."
593,poor,Worst professor you could ever take.
41,good,good
560,average,No Comments
2277,good,Managed a 1500 person class well. His knowledge and enthusiasm for sociology was really absorbed by the students.
2357,good,"Not the best course coordinator, but an amazing lecturer! He may seem weird the first lecture you have with him but as the semester passes by you'll notice the guy has soo much swag and he really knows his stuff.   P.S Watch out for his puns! You may not get the joke but his laugh is really contagious."
243,good,Best teacher at UIC. Period.
1339,good,Always does her best to make sure everyone understands the material. Makes the class fun.
2527,good,"I LOVE YOU, SCOTT"
3547,good,"She's very animated and has an entertaining accent. Class was boring (Hard not to be- large class and the fact that it's biology. I'm not a fan of science). Class wasn't too hard though. If you study well, you should get an A. Don't buy the textbook- she provides slides and study guides. You do need an access code and an iclicker, tho."
1442,poor,"He seems like a good mathematician which is probably wh he has the job, but he is terrible as a teacher. He is hard to hear even in the front, hard to understand if you can hear him. He takes no care in helping you. If you ask for help he averts the effort of helping you by trying to give you such a confusing answer that you stress and give up."
261,average,"His tests were hard, but studying his old exams were more helpful then actually studying his powerpoints. It is easy to get a B in his class and hard to get an A. Lastly, he really needs to learn how to use a mic."
3665,good,"She is a very good teacher! When signing up for 213, choose her session. It is a difficult subject and you will still have to study a lot but she seems to understand this and makes lectures very clear and to the point. More than likely you will be able to understand her lectures, and in order to get As on the exams all you have to do is study."
1689,poor,"Professor Cook is a terrible teacher, and an even worse comedian. The only thing worse than his lessons were his jokes. There was zero learning and zero laughter. I walked into the final exam touting an A average, and failed the exam, which landed me with a final grade of a C. This class was absolutely horrible, and you have no choice but this man."
1725,poor,"i took calc in hs, and like math, i found the class to be easy, but only cus i had an understanding in calc, i do not recomend cook and from what i heard about the other math teachers i dont recomend them either, cook is boring, old and doesnt teach, wish i could say something good, but nothing comes to mind"
4040,poor,"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid. HW is tedious and irrelevant. I work in the industry, this guy sucks and all of his material is WAY too scattered. Doesn't help students, not sure how he got this job, worst professor at mason by far.  Do NOT take him."
834,poor,"This is one of the worst classes i've taken. the concepts would have been easy to understand if he had any clue how to explain them. The material on the tests is so random compared to what he teaches in class. He doesn't prepare you well for the tests at all, and the owls are a pain. Don't take this class unless you absolutley have to."
1866,good,"She is so effervescent!Today 1 of her head TAs,Dmitry,taught lecture for an exam review and it was *blah* Within the first 5 minutes he lost everyone & everyone started doing their own thing or dozing off.Made us appreciate Prof Whitbourne a heck of alot more than we normally do!She is a fabulous,knowledgeable lady(w/ lame jokes!) I &lt;3 Whitbourne!"
2010,good,"Excellent Teacher, excellent class.  Insane amounts of extra credit.  USEFUL information for college students (STDs, Birth control, cancer etc.).  Fun class to go to, she shows entertaining movie clips and uses props to solidify her points.  Dr. Goodenough is the best teacher I could have asked for my first semester at UMass."
340,good,"Dr Molumby, if you are reading this, I love you!!!"
1601,poor,No Comments
4132,good,"This class killed my GPA.  I am a good student I went to all his classes, paid attention and turned in all assignments.  I spent alot of time on his &quot;project&quot; and walked out with a C.  I know people who didn't even get that. If you want a tough class/professor look no further, his/he is the hardest one I have come across at GMU so far."
480,average,Professor Capelotti is hilarious! His powerpoints are a little confusing and his tests are hard but he always lets you come to him for help.
3024,average,can be boring and hard to understand. the course isn't as easy as some people say.
4065,good,"Best professor I've had at Mason. Yes, he's harder than some but that's only because he actually expects you to work. Go figure! A professor who wants you to actually study...what a concept right&#63; All the people who have rated him badly are either lazy or really stupid."
2361,poor,"Took CHM139 1st semester, passed 1st midterm and decided to drop it as labs were time consuming. Took it again 2nd semester and failed first midterm (evidently harder than other profs). Decided to stick through and did second midterm which was supposedly ""easier"" (quote browning) to compensate for first but format of test was changed (due to strike"
4396,poor,"*DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS* I repeat, *DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS*! Guy is totally whack, I got a C in this course, and two of my other friends took the same class w/ different profs and both got A's. Take O'Toole, I heard she was good. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
1766,poor,i hate calculus..but i guess he knows his stuff..if i went to class i guess that would help...
4186,good,"This was the first online course I took. Ms. Wolf was very engaging by sharing all kinds of various personal anecdotes and experiences. I enjoyed this course despite the grading rubric being a little harsh. Exams are primarily taken from the lecture and the online videos. Lab is almost completely useless, it's more just a point of contact with you."
4001,poor,"This course revolves around a project that makes up the majority of your grade. He provides ZERO instruction or guidance as to what he wants us to do, but expects A-quality work. In addition to that, he is very unapproachable with questions you might have. Lastly, the course is just irrelevant, has no structure, and it just needs to be removed."
2962,good,very interesting professor
3280,poor,"I worked my ass off in this class and still got an F.  She obviously undertstands the topics herself, but her ability to relay that information on to her students is abscent.  Do not take this teacher."
3066,poor,"I cannot say if Christ will return, yet this man single handedly proves Satan DOES!!!!  Take this course if you are a masochist; you will never recover."
1271,good,"Very fun professor - it's tough to get up for a 9am class but she tries to make it enjoyable. Grade is based on 4 exams (one is dropped), easy online quizzes, and in class quizzes based on assigned readings. Does lots of in class activities to make sure the material is understood, which adds a fun element to lecture. I"
3828,poor,"I'll agree with everyone else.  No one goes to lecture, thus no one learns anything.  Nice lady, kinda dumb, doesnt explain much.  Read the book, her study guides suck, not many people do well on her exams.  and she class is really early too.  Read book"
3832,average,"BORING! She reads off the slides, her exams are tough, AVOID her if you could!"
2398,good,"He is an AMAZING guy, with the best teaching abilities in U of T! YES PEOPLE, his tests are hard (I have failed one). However, he challenges your mind and you ability to understand chemistry. If u r used to memorizing equations, don't take his class, but whoever enjoys doing it, I shall prefer it to them!"
347,good,Completely unpredictable! Unusual but COOL!
3010,poor,No Comments
4038,average,"Homework is worth 40% of your grade. There are usually only 4 or 5 assignments, so make sure you do them all. Don't leave it to last minute as it will take some time. Attend his lectures and take notes from slides as well. If he asks a question and no one answers it correctly, he'll put it on the final. He's not bad--just difficult to contact him."
3982,good,I hated the idea of taking art history. But her class is excellent! She takes a dull subject and makes it fun and interesting. Gives a study guide for the 2 exams.
1423,good,"Best professor i've had, my psych class has 500 kids and it still feels like shes teaching me individually..Shes a great professor, very very helpfull..I got alot out of the class."
4081,good,"He does have an abrasive personality, but did you pay to be babysat or did you pay to learn something&#63; He certainly knows his stuff, leave the dignity and pride elsewhere and it can be entertaining. He rarely smiles and always wears sunglasses...even when dark. He gives good analogies where needed and teaches only what needs to be taught, no fluff."
2102,good,very organized and an overall good professor
632,poor,As far as teaching goes he does not stay on topic most of the time and starts talking about things that have nothing to do with British Literature. He grades harshly while putting students down indirectly in class. For everyone out there never take a class with him cause he is unprofessional. Dont make the same mistake I made.
2494,good,"Browning is amazing...The world still makes sense for crying out loud! He's an excellent prof, really clear and he makes sense...looks like George McFly at the end of Back to the Future, it's kind of funny."
3502,good,"Her voice makes you want to pay attention to the material. It's obvious she loves biology and really tries to make you like it. Her test are really hard though. She does give out study guides but they're so long. You need to study like 2 weeks before the exam. Always do the homework online, you can fail every test and still pass if you do the hw!"
2570,poor,One of the worst profs I have ever had She should be teaching high school instead of a class in an MBA program. Rotman should be ashamed that she is still there inspite of the horrible reviews over the years.
2798,good,A good fellow with a very bad handwriting. Can't type his lectures.
1465,average,"I was really nervous for this class-math is NOT my strong subject at all. Rudvalis can at times be confusing with his explanations, but at other times he's explaining is helpful. He is extremely fair when it comes to homework and tests. He gives many review sessions and additional opportunities to complete h.w. He's understanding; not arrogant."
4339,good,my favorite teacher!! he's the best
115,good,Mehran rocks my socks off.
3972,good,Great just go to class and talk with her and you will be in
1494,average,"this guy is alright, might be a little crazy, but so are the best of us"
1232,poor,BORING!!!
2229,poor,"In a word........BAD! Avoid is course at all possible costs! If in his course, avoid life sucking lectures."
1153,good,"Great professor, great guy.  Take this class with him."
3026,good,LOVED the class. Great experience. Cares alot about students...
57,good,Mehran is good! 106A is good. Take the class!!!
3448,average,I wouldn't recomend this teacher. I imagine you could find a more relaxed professor.
4348,good,"dr dennis is a great professor, he really knows what he is talking about. his lectures are somewhat boring, but once you get used to his style of lecture, it's all good. and always do the study guides before exams cuz that's practically the exam right there. and his laugh is so hilarous! i reccomend taking him. =D"
1735,poor,"the worst teacher ever, who cares about how the formulas were developed.. TEACH US HOW TO USE THEM! dont take this class if you cant teach yourself some pretty difficult math"
3495,average,"good professor. You need to study but lectures are clear and to the point. She is the best at Mason. Take her if you want a good grade, but pay attention and do hw. Don't skip class. Most profs. at Mason can't teach, but she can. If you want to pass take her, very energetic, makes you learn. PowerPoint are very helpful too.  TAKE HER."
3300,poor,"Hylton treats students like children, constantly yelling at them to put their feet down or put their phones away. Not a good teacher, and I got screwed by having a bad TA as well. Tests are heavy on material and very tricky. It is possible to get a decent grade, but be prepared to do a ton of studying."
3688,good,"Dr. Fondufe was a great professor - very clear lectures and notes, given with enthusiam. Tests were not difficult if you went over the detailed study guides...take her for biology if you can! Willing to help during office hours and is very understanding."
707,good,"This lady is a nutjob but in the good sense. Caring, funny, sweet, she's the best. Made the enviroment comfortable and tried to get everyone involved. If she teaches any other course in the future, I won't doubt to take her class..."
1093,good,He is smart and funny.
4309,average,"Honestly he is the NICEST professor ever, you have to go to class for the journal, 3 tests, 3 quizzes and thats basically it. very easy class, NEED THE BOOK! his lectures are pointless and are not tested on, everything tested on comes from the book, the journal is the only reason you have to go to class; he's so nice though! and old haha"
1376,good,LOVED THIS CLASS! Prof. Rahhal is amazing.  It's very easy to get an A.  The class is fun and interesting...I actually wanted to go to this class and it left me wanting to know more about psych..definitly recommend it
72,good,"He is one of the best professor i have ever seen in my life . His teaching is simply good. The way he explained each and every concept is excellent . I completed the entire CS106A lectures in two days .He knows how to attract students certainly not by giving em chocolates but through his teaching skills .. I love Mr.Sahami, you changed my life."
1922,good,"She made Psych 100, has a lot of fun, I recommend her to anyone!"
2460,average,"Tries too hard to be funny, really not that hilarious. Acts like an awkward teenager, maybe never grew out of it. The test was way too hard, half the class failed! Doesn't use time in class wisely, instead of cracking 'jokes', should've been giving out examples to clarify the concepts."
1764,poor,No Comments
743,poor,"If you didn't take calculus in high school, like I didn't, you're gonna have a hard time.  He only teaches the basic principles, and the exams are much more complicated.  The homework is all online, but his lectures are almost 2 weeks behind the homework due dates.  If I wanted to teach myself calculus, I would have taken it online."
2867,good,"The best prof I've had at UofT! Very funny and his passion for sociology really shows in his lectures. Really made sociology interesting. I only went to class to see him, the tests come from the readings so you can skip &still pass as long as you do the readings. I wish Dr. Tepperman could teach all my courses! DO YOUR READINGS and you'll do well"
1005,average,He gives unclear answers when going over questions so you are left wondering what the right answer is. The comments he makes in class and comments he puts on slides when they are uploaded can be contradictory.  Makes you think in depth about problems. 
1190,good,Great prep. for the MCAT! Uses ingenious problem-based learning and makes you apply all your knowledge. Wants students to get the &quot;whole picture&quot; and genuinely wants you to learn and understand! An outstanding professor.
1125,average,"AMAZING PROFESSOR! He has a bad case of ADD, and he goes on MANY tangents.  He often doesn't tell you the answers to questions because his point is to let you think about the question itself.  Basically the same stuff is covered day after day after day, but if you miss a day, you're screwed because you never know what was discussed the day before."
1241,good,"This professor brings the field of psychology to life. There is a lot of reading and you certainly won't pass if you skip lecture, but she makes it worth it. You'll be excited to go to her lectures, even if you didn't have a prior interest in psychology."
2211,good,Excellent proffessor. A leader in his field.
2678,average,"The lectures are too easy. (Of course, the tests are not!)"
998,good,"good class, great professor. As long as you focus on what he says during lectures, it's pretty clear cut. He's very conceptual and teaches you the concept, expecting you to be able to apply them. His exams are mostly true or false questions and can be tricky, but if you look over the lecture slides a few times, it's not hard."
1577,poor,I HATE THIS MAN WITH A FIERY PASSION. He's one of the only 2 people on the planet that I hate. Don't take a class with him. Chances are you won't learn anything and you'll have to take it over.
4214,average,She is so sensitive.  Do not bother her.  She is not happy about teaching.  I think she is fired.
1826,good,"She is a great professor. Her test are really easy and her homework, which is a quiz, on spark are easy as well. you get to chance to to take it and if don't do good the first time you can redo it. The second time it's the same question so you can look at the answer from the 1st attempt and pass it. Overall a very good professor"
4380,poor,"I read all the chapters, went to EVERY class, and sat in the front row despite how BORING they were. His tests have multiple correct answers but you are expected to know the &quot;more correct&quot; answer which is b.s. and he knows it. he needs to go back to vcu/vdu."
4389,good,"yeah, i don't agree with most of these people who rated on here--although he may not have a very interesting lecture class, as long as you read the book and listen to what he emphasises in class, YOU WILL DO WELL!! plus, he allows a lot of extra credit!!!"
2752,poor,"stopped recording lectures, couldn't bear to listen to him twice...worst prof.."
440,good,"He was a great instructor, and increased my interest in dance. He's got a great personality, and makes you happy to be in class...he's also really fair at grading and understanding as a person."
1100,good,"Best professor I've ever had inspired me to be extremly interested in biology. takes time out of his schedule to help students. GO TO REVIEW SESSION he has reviews every thursday, go and learn. great sense of humor, can go fast at times. he really is an amazing teacher, uses a different style than normal I really liked it. great professor!!!"
2369,good,"Teaches a bit slow at times and by doing so, he does a very good job of explaining concepts. Pretty funny professor overall even though he makes the occasional lame joke. Very helpful and approachable if you need extra help or have general questions. He's a jolly person who makes learning orgo interesting. "
649,good,"Before taking Mr. Everett's class, I couldn't stand reading and I couldn't write a decent paper. He taught me how to write well and appreciate reading. I loved that class! He knows what he's talking about and is eager to help when you need it. good class...even better teacher!! Thanks Mr. Everett!"
1546,poor,"This teacher sucks. All of the bad things mentioned about this dude are true. You can skip all the lectures and teach yourself the material and will be set for the tests. Just attend the review sessions they are helpful, but this professor makes it very hard to get out of bed in the morning. I do not recommend this prof."
2754,poor,"just try listening to him and not fall asleep, horrible prof!"
2471,average,"anyone who gives him a pepper has obviously not seen him close up.  he knows that his students like him, and is thus waaayyyy to conceited about it.  however, he was an okay prof.  to bad his ego is larger than the class."
630,good,"He's enthusiastic about the subject matter, and he definetely puts an importance on the history of the subjects we cover. This is a sophomore English class, and he grades like he means it. Not a class for someone who isn't willing to work for a good grade, but not impossible to get an A."
672,good,No Comments
1249,good,"If you're looking for a pass/fail class, take this. I'm sure it's an easy A if you're taking it for a grade too. But Professor Rahhal is very nice and interacts with her students in a fun way. Lectures weren't boring and there are 6 pop quizzes throughout the year so you kinda have to go just incase it's a quiz day."
482,good,"I love Capelotti. He's a great professor. He keeps you interested with jokes, but still teaches with them. Gives extra credit. tests are a little difficult, but if you do the study guide and read you can't fail. plus, he's pretty good looking."
1584,average,Hard Class. I have no clue what is going on. Pretty helful and I wouldnt say he is rude. The class is calculus its hard....
4045,poor,Lyons is unprofessional as a Security head & professor. His homeowrks/quizzes/exams either A)Confuses students or B)Make you loose points unwantedly! Ridiculous amounts of homework & writing that will make you go nuts! Exams are difficult as Lyons wants you to fail hard and avoid the security concent. Also mocks you & your questions when asked.
1462,poor,Terrible teacher. Tough to ask questions when he shoves it in your face that your a moron.The only way i passed the class was by going to the calc help center. If you get him as an instructor i highly advise you to switch. Professor McGibbon is a much better teacher of Calc 2
3049,good,"If you listen in class, do your work, and have half a brain, you'll do fine in Moylan's class. Many of my classmates were whiny pre-med students who wanted to learn ONLY what's on the exams and nothing more. If you're so lazy and want everything spelled out and spoon fed to you, why the hell did you apply to Stanford&#63;&#63;&#63; A's are EARNED,you whiners!"
3653,good,"Very enthusiastic teacher, wants you to do well. I recommend her to anyone taking a biology class. Her tests are really easy if you just study the notes. I wish she would teach all the bio classes."
49,good,"Mehran is the best. He makes CS approachable for beginners, and his lectures are good and are full of funny jokes and candies."
3449,good,she is very energetic.....
4384,poor,"This teacher is confusing at times, but he gives out review sheets that cover pretty much everything that will be on his exams. Study for his final!!! The review sheet he gives for the final has nothing to do with the actual final exam...very confusing..."
858,poor,"He is a very nice person but this class is rediculously hard, especially if you've never taken calc before. The tests are impossible and his lectures are all over the place."
1072,average,"He has a different style of teaching that takes a few weeks to get the hang of.  His lectures are pretty confusing, but reading the book helped me a ton in understanding the material and getting good grades on his exams. Just don't slack off and you should be fine."
719,good,She is the absolute best teacher.  Definetely take her Interpersonal Communications class!!!! I took this class Friday mornings and every week we had great discussions.  Its alot of fun.:)
2542,good,very good
1660,average,Goes on tangents every class and teaches for maybe half the class. Easy to get a good grade but bring entertainment.
1656,poor,very boring and not clear. did not fare well in his class
2743,good,First U of T course where I was supposed to use my brain *no pun intended*.
3352,poor,"Very tough, very fast, very smart.  she knows the material so well it's hard for her to comprehend that we might be learning at a snail's pace while she teaches at a rabbit's pace."
4376,average,"Yeah the tests are multiple choice but rather challenging for something like Sociology. They are almost 100% OUT OF THE BOOK, so unless you want an A+ don't waste your time attending his every lecture, sitting in front, and taking notes. The book, on the other hand, is actually a pretty good read."
2572,poor,Class is interactive. But provides ZERO help outside of class. Never replies to email and TA replies to email 3 weeks later regarding your questions. Grades take forever to come back.
3796,average,"Class is way too easy. You don't have to attend class at all, and labs are a pain in the ass, but definitely an easy A!"
4182,poor,"It's an online class, meaning lectures are online but lab is still in the classroom. She has a monotone voice on the online classes which makes her very boring. Her tests are hard, and ridicously wordy. She tries to make it seem that just because she has a PhD in MGMT that it should be a hard class -- she comes off as rude and her TA's are morons."
3210,good,She is a good teacher and the class isn't that hard. She even allows the second exam score to count for the first if it helps your grade. Lectures feel short because she's good at teaching.  Going to lecture isn't that important but lab helps a lot.
1385,good,"Tammy is good!!! I never skipped this class. She was able to make people want to participate in a 300 person lecture, that's how good she is. Tells cute stories about her twins. Very clear about material. Encourages questions. Lots of extra credit and ways to get a good grade. Definitely A+!"
4145,average,"This professor was funny, but enjoys making smart ass comments to some valid questions.  Tests are do-able if you study, but the project is ridiculous for an introduction to cryptonography."
1399,average,No Comments
1195,poor,One of the worst instructors ever.
1408,good,aw shes such an good teacher. she's sooo clear and understandle and FUN. the classes are so interesting!!! she has made me want to change my major to psychology! take her class for sure.
2974,good,The class was interesting although lots to remember and the prof is good!!!
1798,poor,"You need to come to class to watch all of the videos and understand the notes that you are taking. Everything that she says to study is barely on her exams. You need to read her huge textbook. Shes nice, but shes not helpful. Her TAs do all the work for her, and aren't helpful either. Not many people get over a 70 on exams"
1475,poor,"It's really too bad: the professor seems like a cool enough guy, but he's just a horrible teacher. I did well in this class, but only thanks to the online homeworks and the textbook. Lectures are boring and confusing, exams are impossible. So be ready to basically teach yourself math."
2495,good,Browning kicks ass though his tests are to easy.  But any thing else... anyone who disagrees are probably those medschool clowns who don't want to learn anything.
35,poor,"As much as I was interested in this class before taking it,my motivation for it steadily declined as it progressed.She has the ability to turn interesting topics into boring ones and does not allow anything outside of her rules.Grading is very unfair and she shouldnt teach undergraduate courses because she doesnt know how to deal with young people."
3041,good,Very interesting and entertaining teaching style
2464,good,"He makes his lectures interesting and fun! However, the material he covers in lectures are way too basic...his tests are harder than what he teaches. Great guy but not so great of a prof."
2206,poor,man he's tough!!!
2924,poor,"God I hated this class. I don't think this guy said more than 10 words in a single lecture, other than the lecture where he WASTED our time irrelevently talking about HIS research. Very arrogant and rude. In a course which lasted 3 months, 2.5 of those months were spent on student presentations. I wish I never paid to take this class."
1286,good,"Really decent overall teacher. She's good at engaging the class with all of her personal anecdotes, psych exercises, and videos, making this class very enjoyable. Attendance is mandatory with the SWAs, which aren't too bad. The exams are harder than you'd expect, so definitely take time to study. Take advantage of psych studies for extra credit."
349,average,good professor but hard. his lectures are A LOT more interesting than Murray's. His tests are so hard though..he will purposefully fail the entire class on the first exam to scare u into coming to all lectures and READING the book! his second exam and quizzes dont get much easier. so you need to study a lot..it helps if you have old exams to study
3365,poor,"A very unpleasant personality: abrupt, sarcastic, and a sharp voice. Read the txtbk, GET THE STUDY GUIDE, and go to recitation and you should be able to skip the lect and get a good grade. Do attend last class b4 final to find out what's on final. Sadly, she's the only prof for this class, so grin and bare it."
2829,poor,"He routinely yells at students who ask questions and doesn't seem to care if anyone understands him or not. In four years of university, this is by far the worst professor I have ever had, and I cannot think of a worse person to be in such a prominent position at a leading university."
1681,poor,"By all accounts, an poor professor. He's very unclear, and his jokes probably got old around the dawn of indoor plumbing. Run while you can."
1443,good,"His lectures might be hard to follow at times because he assumes the students are smart enough to follow. He knows his stuff very well, and he is happily willing to explain everything of a complicated problem in great details. OVERALL he is a very nice professor, but too bad he is retiring after this semester."
2520,good,He's so cute when he blushes!!!
1671,average,"Great Guy, but its hard to understand what he is teaching; he goes off tangents and talks about the history of the math than actually teaching us how to do it. If you get Felipe as TA, it is HIGHLY recommended that you go to his SI sessions, especially 2 or 1 days before an exam. It really helps since he hands out review/exam guides."
1179,average,This professor was very nice but beware- his exams were very TRICKY! He put questions on there to trick people a lot. He also didnt always explain concepts very well.
3269,poor,"Hylton does not deserve to be a paid professor at Mason, nor does she deserve the title of being a professor at all. She is a condescending individual who barely comprehends the material herself and should not have the authority to teach it. She makes inaccurate accusations of students cheating and reports them to the honor committee."
3729,good,"Shes a pretty great proffessor. The lectures arn't entirely neccesary, but class is ussually fairly enjoyable because Kim really loves the subject and her class"
2810,poor,"Worst Stats prof ever, wont answer questions and refuses to help. changed to the evening section With Brenner and my mark went up 30% Brenner BTW is  good, take his secthin not mcdonnough"
1916,good,"She has tons of extra credit, which is nice.  The tests arent hard, just study.  Everything is very clear."
1357,good,SOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSO GOOD! she's the most amazing prof ever
1825,good,"I love her, the class was pretty easy, her approach to the class was fun , she is very excited to get the material out,the time is a pain in the ass but you don't need to show up most of the time."
786,good,"Such a great professor. Taught the material at good pace and kept the class laughing. Easy to understand teaching method. Incredibly nice and will go out of his way to help you, so long as you ask."
469,average,"He's a good teacher, but he doesn't help you prepare for exams. He makes class kind of interesting. There are no study guides, and his test averages are low."
140,good,Good humor!  Hard but fair!
788,average,"really nice guy. willing to help if you ask. a little out of his element as far as technology goes, but actually cares about his students."
323,good,The class was pretty easy.  Reading the book and attending lecture helped alot.  The sample exams really gave you an idea of what was on the exam.  Labs were kind of too easy though.  Prof kept my attention- good lecturer.
4201,good,She is the best professor.
714,good,"wonderful, wonderful professor :)"
3815,good,"Not an easy A but a likely B.  Definately way easier than any other science gen ed.  Look on the power points to see if there's an in class activity, if there isn't... go back to bed, you'll thank yourself later.  The material is so easy yet she'll trick you on tests but she's nice otherwise."
4235,poor,Oh she is horrible.  She would not give me 0.8% to pass the class....so b/c of that I have to retake it and repay for it.  She is soo unapproachable and very confussing!  I wish there were more MGMT prof's...b/c then I would not have taken her.  And yes her exams are hard. Good luck!
3694,good,"Dr. Largen is an extremely passionate professor. She obviously knows what she's talking about and is genuinely interested in it as well. The class was easy, but I'm also an environmental studies major. All you have to do is take notes on the power points and review the ""quiz"" questions and you should get an A on the tests."
4199,good,"The tests are easy, there is one paper, and tons of extra credit. Go to lab, take the online quizes, and watch the lecture. An 'A' is not difficult to get."
3256,poor,"One of the worst professors I have ever had at George Mason. She knows nothing. If you don't understand and ask her, she even makes fun of you. She judges students based on her feeling. No grading scale on assignments."
406,good,No Comments
2614,poor,"For those who haven't taken accounting - this class is hell! She explains nothing and tests are retarded and have nothing to do with the text book or lectures! Terrible prof. From the other hand - if you've taken accounting before, don't go to class and you'll be fine. Class is only frying up your brain. Do past tests and you might survive."
1004,poor,loves trick questions
890,good,"Doesnt prepare you for the tests well, but they arnt made by him..."
2673,poor,the worse teacher ever!!!  she has such an annoying voice.  she blabbers about irrelevant topics.  she regurgitates the textbook.  her tests are out of nowhere!!! do not take this course!! i stopped going to classes and just taught myself (& did better).
3195,good,"Guys, it's an accounting class. I took Professor Hylton's online course over the summer and was honestly lost until she posted her own lectures. She's very straight forward with the study guides and it helps immensely if you listen to the subtle hints in her lectures. I'd take her again- she's great at explaining the material!!"
3559,average,She's the chillest teacher ive had so far. mad upbeat. dont bother with the book bc u wont need it. powerpoints will do just fine. study for the tests tho. and do the study guides.
3013,good,"A lot of people complaining about the course don't realize that virology IS a lot of information - period! He made the subject very interesting, he works with the students at their levels, is available for help anytime, all the time. This course was a great experience. He's not unorganized either. Highly recommended, but be prepared for the volume."
303,good,"This class honestly was the only class I actually enjoyed this semester. I enjoyed his lectures and his metal references(and cob shirts). His tests were pretty much impossible, even when I studied I received a B, but I feel like I've learned a lot from this class. I liked him! If you want an A though, you need to study for the tests HARD."
3857,good,"Lisa is phenomenal. By far one of the best professors I've taken while at GMU. She is inspirational, hilarious, down to earth and just an overall knowledgeable teacher. I would (and have) recommend her to anyone, regardless of major. She makes the lectures fun and her tests aren't too difficult if you take notes. TAKE HER, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!"
2909,good,"It has been my experience that with Tepperman, you will receive good amounts of attention and useful help if you are genuinely: hard working, interested, outgoing and mature. He is available and supportive if you properly take advantage of him as the professor he is."
664,good,"He will teach you everything about grammar, then expect you to know it. If you just want an easy English credit, this is not the class for you. If you've wondered how to use a comma and feel like learning to write coherently, he's good for that. He WILL keep you to the end of the class and ramble a bit when trying to answer a question, though."
1177,good,"Two words. THE MAN. He has no name other than that. Truly a God in a man's diguise. I hear his tests suck, though."
1947,good,"Relatively easy class, but tests can get decently challenging. "
3562,poor,"She was not a very good professor. She was very energetic, but not clear on her pronunciation. She was hard to follow and her tests were very difficult."
2132,good,"I actually really liked Brym. I found him interesting and his teaching style is very straightforward. I became interested in Sociology because of him, so I worked hard and got a good mark in this course. If you go to all the lectures, do your reading and study you'll be fine."
3477,good,This class covers a lot of material but is enjoyable. To study it's really important you split the content into several days rather than crash the night before. I pretty much memorized the lecture slides and got A's on all her exams. I clickers were easy points and usually occur at the end of each chapter. Put in the work and the grade will follow.
961,good,Extremely chill. Fun and cool.
2009,good,"Great professor. For such a huge lecture group she offers a lot to make it possible for all to succeed.  Material interesting and useful, especially for college students.  I only wish she was more aggressive with shutting up the kids that wouldn't stop talking during lecture."
2149,good,"A bit tough, but do it right and you're gonna be OK. Go through the readings carefully, a lot of the questions are on specific details."
2696,average,He's my homeboy!!... very knowledgeable prof and the teaching style is perfect for 3rd year course. I recommend you to take this class!!...
3015,good,"I enjoyed this course. It's possible to do well with minimal effort. It's only 2 hours/week and tests are short and multiple choice. On top of that, he automatically adds 5% to all term tests. Also, the material he teaches is useful in the real world like learning about West Nile, SARS, HIV, etc."
304,good,"I recieved a C in Dr. Molumby's class, but he was a pretty decent teacher. I agree the antedotal lectures are fun when you are there, however not when it comes to the final grade. Exams are hard, Labs are easy and so are the problem sets. He is a really nice guy though"
3970,good,"Loves what she teaches, tries to make it fun for all. Work load isnt too heavy, the study guides she gives out for tests tell you everything that might show up on exams. Some don't need the book, but I bought it and it really comes in handy to look stuff up."
1496,good,"Rudvalis is a nice guy.  I can understand people's comments about his &quot;long-winded notes,&quot; but I found them helpful.  You really don't even need to go to the class if you're that frustrated with his teaching style.  All his examples are straight from the text.  If you are having trouble, see him at office hours and he'll teach you one on one."
916,good,THE BEST TEACHER EVER!!!! I ABSOUTELY LOVE HER !
3290,poor,"STAY AWAY FROM HER!!!! SHE IS HORRIBLE, DOES NOT CARE ABOUT STUDENTS, DOES NOT TEACH AT ALL, I'M A 4.0 STUDENT, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE $1000 ON THIS CLASS, TAKE IT W/ KITCHING OR EVEN BAKER, ANYONE IS BETTER THAN HER!"
3416,good,"Very harsh and stern.  also, a tough grader.  I changed 3 answers on my scantron, and the machine picked up the wrong answers.  when i brought this to her attention, she accused me of cheating!"
1624,poor,"He doesn't teach anything in class don't even bother going. all online homework, completely useless teaching, doesn't help AT ALL. STAY AWAY"
2977,good,best professor ever. just that simple.
821,poor,"This teacher is terrible. He's a good guy, and wants everyone to do well, but his lectures are completely useless. It's hard to get an A because his exams only contain 14 questions meaning you can only afford to get one wrong on each exam. His final was nothing like he said it would be. Most questions we had never even seen before. TERRIBLE."
4157,average,No Comments
1354,good,BEST CLASS AT UMASS..its easy its interesting the lectures are actually fun ant tammy is amazing! TAKE THIS CLASS
3825,average,Easy class but very boring lectures. Just read the notes online and study the questions on the CD she get alot of exam questions from there.
3883,good,Best professor ever! so down to earth and enjoyable to listen to. I had no interest in art prior to this class but she made it so fun and enjoyable. Definitely have to study to get a good grade but she gives you a study guide. Most tests are written and she's very fair when she grades those so it's easy to get an A
1000,good,He's such a nice guy but his tests are difficult with a lot of true/false and he uses a RIDICULOUS amount of diagrams in class.  He uses the iClicker and has (pop?) quizzes on Friday but sometimes allows group quizzes (depending on how much you push him).
18,good,"Good teacher.  Not too hard to figure out what her politics are, but she grades fair. Kind of tough, but she gets a lot more laid back in upper level classes."
1637,poor,"Cook is a nice and funny guy, but his teaching can come up a little short. Goes off on tangents frequently and explains things a little more difficult than they have to be. I thought the material would be super easy since the first thing we did was antiderivatives for a good 2 weeks, but then ramped it up and it got very hard. The TA taught better."
1667,poor,"He is by FAR the WORST professor in UMASS. His lectures are very unorganized, so it's hard to take notes in class. He has no information about the class posted on his site. He is not clear in his lectures. If it wasn't a required course, I would avoid him."
493,poor,this teacher is horible... he stands in front of class and talks for an hour and lookes up at the end of class and asks if anyone has questions and then doesent answer them... he told a student who had a low D that he shouldent drop the corse (this is a few days b4 the late drop period) and said he would be fine... THE FAILED HIM! DONT TAKE HIM!!!!
3200,poor,Im a transfer student and my last college accounting class was great (nd its rated lower  than GMU business) compare to her lessons. She goes all over the place to explain the simplest thing. Tbh i would transfer back after a month being her class. 
3554,good,"Dr. Fondufe was very approachable and a great teacher. Beware, her tests are very difficult. You will need to know the powerpoints inside and out, and be able to explain the concepts taught very well."
687,good,"Dr. Sacher is a really sweet, funny woman. This class was very easy, requiring just one big paper, 10 weekly 1 page journals, and a final presentation. Much of the course is based on dialogue, which sometimes turns it into a therapy session for some people, but overall, I would take a class with Dr. Sacher in a heart beat."
2897,good,"Really great, thorough prof.  He definitely challenges his students with his tests, but his lectures are really clear, and he explains concepts well.  He has a good sense of humour, and throws jokes in now and then to keep class fun.  I've taken two classes with Tepperman."
1608,poor,"rude, unclear, boring, pony tail......"
3166,average,"Intense lectures. Need to do homework and quizzes to actually learn and practice ideas. Not a bad class, curves final grade."
2644,average,"Lectures are very boring, since she justs reads from the slides. Final exam was impossible."
1009,good,"Prof. Phillis' class was challenging yet rewarding. He cares more about how biological systems work over straight-up vocabulary. This is reflected in weekly quizzes and the exams, but go to lecture because he doesn't teach out of the textbook and gives iClicker questions to help. If you go to his review sessions and tot SI, you will be successful."
4031,average,"Hard class, at least one exam is very hard. Homework 2 is tough. Lecture slides are very good. Be timely and work hard and you have nothing to worry about. I did very well. Does curve so that is nice. Big issues with ML is that he is disconnected from students and students feel very intimidated and tense. He was helpful to me when I made an error."
1327,good,"Tammy is a good prof. her classes are pretty interesting, you can buy the older editions of the textbooks to save money, attendance isn't required but there are random writing assignments assigned in class. Exams are hard but overall good class"
1677,poor,Prof is a nice guy but he shouldn't be teaching. His teaching style is random and he does a horrible job of actually explaining the material. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND DROP THIS CLASS ASAP OR ELSE YOUR GONNA SUFFER THROUGH THE SEMESTER
1999,good,"I loved her. She is so entertaining, which is hard in a class of 500. You don't need the book (which she wrote!) and you don't need to to come to class.  But I've gone to every single class because she's so interesting and I love the subject matter. Makes me want to go into biology."
1310,good,"Tammy is the greatest! She is so sweet and she makes the class so interesting. She tells a lot of personal stories to apply the material to the real world. For each type of assignment, she drops the lowest grade. The class is easy, but it's also interesting, so you're motivated to do well. Take this class with Tammy; you'll be happy you did!"
1987,good,"this woman is the best. she makes learning bio so easy. tests are fairly easy, especially because she uses the pyramid system, which means you get to take the test twice and the second time you take it you can use the notes. no homework, plenty of extra credit, and never have to read the textbook. notes are available to print."
3515,good,"Every lecture is on a power point which are uploaded to blackboard before the class starts each day, very easy to follow along, but also very easy to become side tracked as she simply reads from the slides most times."
344,good,"Well knowledgeable professor. Attend all his lectures if you want an A. Get a hold of recent practice exams, because his old ones are nothing like the actual test. Contrary to what other people say, it isn't impossible to get an A - you just need to put effort. By the way, if you want to score really high on his exams, read the book."
3198,poor,"Professor Hylton is a tough professor who doesn't respect her students or the hard work they put into taking this class. This class was part of my general education requirements and I am not a major in the school of business, but Professor Hylton still made it tough for me get through her class. I would not recommend her at all. Do not take her!"
986,poor,"Randy is a very nice guy, but man is he confusing and loves trick questions. He expects us all to have a biology background, which I did not. The review sessions do not help at all, as he loves trick questions. All True/False. I hated biology before this and now I hate it even more. But he is a good person, just needs to teach more clearly/direct."
2989,good,I LOVE HIM!! He is such an amazing Prof. He makes me wanna cry (in a good way). I wish there were more of him. I feel privileged to be taking his class and to listen to his lectures. Those who get this opportunity are extremely lucky because it is life changing. I love him to tears. Thank you Professor! I hope you know you are wonderful.
3494,good,"The professor is very clear in her language and is energetic. It helped to see her speak in a positive tone and she gave emphasis on things that was important to remember, which was helpful for studying for the test."
4316,poor,"He is nice. But his test are RIDICULOUS. You have to be in his mind set to get the answer right. Read the book, & well just watch out for some questions.. his class is not impossible to pass tho. I ended up with a B."
2725,poor,No Comments
1142,good,great teacher but it took time to get used to his style of teaching.  people normally adore him or hate his guts
1198,good,"Randall rocks, by far the best teacher I've had so far. I actually thanked him for being such a good teacher when I saw him outside of class. His teaching is clear and entertaining."
85,good,Funny and Effective teaching
1518,poor,"poor PROFESSOR.  Do not take his class!!!!!!!! If you have to, then sign up for it on SPIRE but just go to another math 127 class because you will probably become dumber from sitting through his lectures."
4004,poor,What really concerned me are the quizzes he assigned. I felt I answered it correctly but was only given partial or no credit. He can be rude to some students. Most of the homework are easy though.
1381,good,"I couldn't agree more with everyone. Simply a phenomenal teacher who connects very well with students. Upbeat, hilarious, and made the material very interesting and easy to understand. Definitely one of the best at UMass and impossible to dislike!"
2390,good,Difficult tests but overall amazing professor. Knows material really well and extremely helpful after lectures.
1014,good,"He's good just go to the SI review sessions, they really help a lot. Hard to pay attention the whole lecture but it is a must if you don't want to get confused."
128,good,"Just a great professor all around.  You can tell he really enjoys teaching, and knows the material like the back of his hand.  He always has great side stories relevant to the topic to tell; I actually used the other side of my notebook to make notes of just his stories.  He also has his own condensed noteset for the textbook, for free."
1364,good,Tammy's just the best. She's really funny and has a great grading policy. First thing she told us was that food and drinks were fine in class despite all the signs around the building.
2820,average,No Comments
2423,good,A great prof. Good speaker. Fairly easy tests. Really easy final exam. Good course.
891,poor,No Comments
3329,good,Mrs. Hylton's acct 361 class is rocks! It is very intersting: that simple. She is the best. Take her if you have a chance.
1359,good,"Has her teaching down to a science. Easy to obtain an A, and provides fun demonstrations in class to keep you interested."
307,good,"Molumby is a very knowledgeable teacher, however is delivery is confusing at times. His jokes and stories are great, but it's easy to get lost during lectures. Labs and write ups and discussion are easy points. Problems sets kind of bogus, exams are difficult. Getting a C is easy , the challenge is getting an A. Random I-clicker questions too."
1661,good,"He really gets the material across well and is very invested in helping you learn.  If you don't get something, he'll teach it until you get it.  He's also really entertaining for an old dude as well."
3203,average,"You know what you're getting if you take a course with Hylton. I had her for 203 and 301. Neither was easy. In 301 you're gonna have 3 tests make up 95% of your grade.  Other 5% is participation. Doesn't matter, if you don't go to class, you'll fail. Only way you learn the material. STUDY HARD, keep up with text and connect, maybe youll get a B."
1317,good,"Easiest class I've ever taken. If you go to class, do the reading at least sometimes, and study for the test, its a cake walk. There is even a ridiculous amount of extra credit on top of how easy it is. And she drops quizzes and tests, so with a month left in school, I had a A and didn't have to attend anymore. But she's a great teacher so I did!"
3475,good,"Passionate teacher, truly loves what she does. Dr. Fondufe puts a fun twist on bio lecture. Be sure to review powerpoints before exams (lowest test is dropped, if final exceeds lowest score) Great base knowledge for upper level biology and chemistry courses."
3403,average,"Go to class, because she gives the type of questions that she is going to put on her exams.  Her tests can be challenging at times, but if you do the hw you will be fine.  Her final is pretty difficult, so make sure you lock down the other exams."
1208,good,I love randy
3818,good,This class is a pain! It isn't hard but REALLY tedious. A lot of this stuff I learned in middle school. The professor is EXTREMELY nice but REALLY boring. She reads directly off the slides. Labs are pretty pointless too. If you want an easy science Gen ED this is it- but don't expect to LEARN!
3885,good,She is simply great. This class is not too easy but it is totally worth to take.
2372,good,Great prof! He was enthusiastic and explained concepts very clearly. He definitely renewed my interest in chemistry. His mid-term questions were quite reasonable.
1239,good,"Tammy is clearly enthusiastic, and often goes on tangents and supplements the theory with examples from her daily life, which is useful. She will give 'SWAs' which are basically 5 sporadic (but easy) questions about specific case studies to see whether you've read them, but these aren't bad at all. Alwys stays behind after her interactive lectures."
2289,average,"Boring Lectures,"
275,average,"He seems like such a cool person to be friends with but he's not a great lecturer or professor. Very tricky exams. Multiple choice but he gives so many options (A and B; All of the above, A B and C) things like that. It throws a person off because almost all of his questions are like this! If you think you can handle that then take him!"
489,average,"Pay attention to movies, especially what anthropologist related to which movie. Read book or you won't pass. Understand the notes you take because the tests will not be just spitting back the presentations. He will work with you if you make the effort."
3738,good,"im a gov major and this was my first science class and i thought it was extremely easy. i took this in the summer and the hours and labwork were brutal, but as long as u do it she basically gives u 100 on everything. just look at the powerpoints for the tests and u should get an A. i would definitely recommend her if u need to knock out a lab class"
1229,good,Good man. Hellllooooooooo
3921,good,"She is very fun and energetic!! She makes the  material interesting. You must attend class, she keeps track and it will help ur grade. She does not post anything up on Blackboard. Take NOTES!!! The study guides are very helpful and if you dnt know an answer ask her. She will help you. If you study you'll be fine. She's an good prof!!!"
3516,good,"Fondufe is a wonderful prof. Lectures are long but thorough and easy to understand. Great at helping and explaining. Material is difficult though, you will have to study for exams. Don't buy the textbook, all powerpoints are posted online and are the source of test material. READ THEM. Occasional iclicker quiz the only reason to attend. Loved her!!"
2468,good,He was really fun to talk to after class.
3605,good,"She teaches directly off the PP, and PP is posted online always. I mainly just study the PP and not the book and still do well on her tests. Her tests are hard if you don't study. Make sure you understand the concepts and not just memorize because she asks very detailed questions in the tests. Overall great teacher!Class average on tests b/w 70-75%"
1058,good,Randy is an good person if you get to know him. If you read the textbook BEFORE the lectures this class will be very easy. I hated being left in the dark about my grades though. Love Randy but I don't know if I'd take his class again.
2166,good,good prof!
281,good,Molumby is a great lecturer and will effortlessly hold your attention throughout the lecture. Exams are all multiple choice and the questions are very tricky. Powerpoints slides are helpful but you do have to read the textbook on your own. Some of the labs are equal to a joke. Easy class if your put the required effort.
4249,poor,"Wolf is a nice person but does not know how to teach. Also all the questions come from publisher of the book which makes her lazy. Go to her boring lectures, and take a good note. I had D on 1st test, lower c on the second and pass the class with a B.Make all possible means to go to labs because they are easy points.Katherine Hildebrand is  good TA"
1316,good,"She's an good teacher and the best one for Psych 100. Very interesting. As long as you keep up with the reading, study for an hour for the exams, you should get an A. Do the SONA extra credit. It got be from an A- to an A. She drops the lowest exam. Study for the first 3, do extra credit, and SPARK quizzes, and drop exam 4. NO FINAL!"
968,good,Schurter is actually the best professor I've ever had. He has a genuine interest in his students and really cares about everyone. He makes class interesting and keeps you entertained on what normally would be a dry subject. TAKE JR YEAR WRITING WITH HIM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT
3207,average,She is not as bad as everyone says. Accounting is a class that you definitely have to study for. She goes over all the information but I used the book a lot also to help reinforce the lectures. She is not afraid to call you out in class if you are not paying attention but that is just because she wants everyone to pay attention.
4313,poor,"Lectures are scattered and pointless. He does not use powerpoint, he just talks and talks and talks. He is very old and his class is boring. If you're going to take him, bring a pillow. Sends out study guides before each quiz and test about the topics on them. That is the only upside to taking his class. Read the book, don't listen to him."
3433,good,This is the type of class where you have to read the book and do all of the assigned hw problems to really grasp the concepts of accounting. I think the book is  very well written as well. Mrs. Hylton expects her students to do the assigned hw so that the lectures will simply be a review for them.
619,good," see a lot of comments here about ""Easy A's."" If that's what you are looking for, go to some sleazy online money trap and buy yourself a degree. If you want to learn about composition, writing, and literature FOR REAL then take his classes. He loves what he does (for real!) and respects those that want to learn. "
4233,good,"straight foward class, no tricks, not hard but not easy, one of those gotto go through the motions to get the degree classes like SOM 301, 99% of the work is in lab and thats easy as long as u show up, but felt like she was just waiting for me to cheat on something and theres no need in this class"
1742,good,"He is really fare in person, but he is certainly out to get you on the exams.  If you email him and tell him you need a certain grade for your major he will reconsider you grade."
3881,good,"She's good, definitely makes the worth going to. The class is super fun, can get difficult, but if you go to class, take notes, pay attention, and study you will get an A. Take her class! Don't buy the textbook... if you're into textbooks just rent it. I rented mine, didn't use it once."
3137,poor,"This guy is unintelligible.  I actually think I'm getting WORSE at calculus.  His tests are TERRIBLE.  Thank god for the TAs, or everyone would flunk."
1847,good,Most defiantly a morning person.
1579,poor,"He writes EVERYTHING (yes everything) down, so its confusing while taking notes.  Calc isn't that easy anyway, but they do scale the tests. Youll need a tutor or study session for this class. Dont rely on lecture alone. I dont remember using the book alot"
1655,good,A good professor who has good intentions. His age does make it a little harder to understand but he knows his stuff and if you aren't retarded you will do fine.
2352,poor,He's funny but his questions are confusing...I loved Chemistry in grade 12 and 11 got very high marks but in Uni my mark dropped not by a grade but really low and now my marks made me hate chemistry
2212,good,"Mostly a very interesting lecturer, can drone on at times. Very interesting presentation of course material, but know your stuff!The tests are ridiculous!"
2020,good,"She is THE best Bio teacher I could have had first semester at UMass. Looked forward to her class, she genuinely cares about making us understand. She is frickin hilarious and gives you absolutely every chance possible to get an A. She's not even 5 feet tall yet she has the respect of 99% of people in the room...that says a lot!"
1956,good,"Professor Goodenough is an INCREDIBLE professor - she is clear, funny, and completely modest. She truly cares about her students and wants everyone to do well. The way the class is set up makes it virtually impossible not to get an A. She is kind and her exams are a breeze. She manages to make BIO fun-also tons of extra credit! Take this class!!!"
1307,good,"Great professor, best 100 class. go to class, read the book, do homeework, extra credit... EASY A"
2003,good,"I highly recommend this class for a gen ed! She is hilarious and the class is all about sex and stds, it's really interesting to follow along. She does great demonstrations and is a really nice lady. There are 3 tests and one is dropped, and optional term paper to boost your grade. She also gives lots of extra credit! this was my favorite class"
575,poor,harder tests
3169,good,"She's very fair. Her lecture's were good and also attendance is optional. Her tests are very fair and she tells you exactly what will be on them, you just have to study. The HW/Quizzes were very easy. She even made a second grading scale that made the final worth more to give you a chance to recover with a good final grade. I liked her a lot"
1706,good,Calc 2 is not an easy subject therefore it is important to look for extra help. you cannot expect to do well by simply showing up to class and taking notes. The math help center is good for reinforcement and Prof Cook is usually available whenever you would like to schedule an appointment.
2905,average,Too much reading for a half-year. Test prtty detailed; ask for numbers in table.
2700,good,"Very knowledgeable prof - its obvious he's been teaching the material for some time. At first I didn't like him at all, but he grew on me. I'm guilty of occasionally falling asleep in class but considering it's not his job to teach us how to pay attention he is an excellent prof. tests are fair, no tricks, straight from lecture. just gotta study"
3501,good,"Fondufe was a very charismatic, passionate professor who clearly cares about all of her students. iClicker quizzes are pop quizzes so make sure to bring your clicker with you every class, tests are based off the powerpoints, lectures can get dry but this is due to the material itself (not the prof.). Overall, a clear-cut course and fun professor."
861,average,"He is a very very nice guy, cares for his students but you will have to make all the effort for any help you want, and if you want an A be ready to do a lot of work and learning yourself because his lectures will not get you an A on the exams, which tend to be very tricky."
1801,poor,She likes to hear herself talk. DONOT TAKE WITH HER. They make everyone take the final even though its optional because they wont release your exam 3 grades until after. Have to buy her book and notes so its 300 for loose leaf paper. AVOID
1628,poor,He's all over the place in lectures and often does out long complicated problems on the board and only mentions when he's finished that it won't be on the test and he just wanted to show us where things come from. He doesn't explain what he's teaching--just scribbles on the board without explaining. Go to TA led review sessions--they will save you!
1993,good,"This was the easiest class ever. If you need a BS for one of your gen eds take this class. At first I went to every class, but thats not necessary. Just read the packet of notes and take the practice test and you should be fine. I got over a 90 on each exam. She also offers so much extra credit that I ended   up with over a 100 average in the class"
269,poor,Goes off tangents. a lot. exams are hard. not helpful at all. avoid him if you can.
629,good,He is passionate about literature and gives his students a lot of tools to utilize in order to excel in the class. He is also articulate and intelligent. I would highly recommend him to anyone who needs a literature class.
2334,poor,"if he wrote the text, why is he UNABLE to speak without notes? lectures=text"
300,good,"Molumby is good! And yes I think he's hot - he likes heavy metal and beer and bees and he talks about them often but he's interesting and makes going to class worth it. Exams, however, were pretty brutal, so study everything! :-/"
459,poor,"I believe myself to be a  reasonable student and I do not know why he is allowed to teach Anthro. I am not failing his class, however,  his tests are as if he purposely wants to bring your grades down. In the beginning of his class he almost bragged about his classes usually having a low C average. He is not helpful and his work is unnecessary."
1447,good,"i really didn't have as hard of a time with this guy as a lot of other people seem to, i just found him to be very awkward. he did seem to make an effort to take and answer questions, but it was a very large class and i guess he felt he had to move on. not a great explainer but read the book, do the hw, you will be ok. i barely went and got an A-."
1472,poor,Taking this class was the worst idea I have ever had. This class makes me wants to drop out of college and being my career over again at another institution. He is the worst professor I have ever had the unfortunate time to meet.
2046,average,"She's a very amusing professor, but dispenses alot of the same information over and over again...kind of tedious. As long as you go to class once and awhile, you shouldn't have trouble."
3351,poor,"She goes through the powerpoint slides without doing a good job at explaining the material. So, you have to do a lot of the learning on your own by reading the text. Coming to class was kinda useless, but sometimes she tells news stories or anecdotes and puts one or two questions on the exam about it. Exams are straightforward."
2922,poor,"i hate him his comments are not constructive feedback just plain rude and not helpful. Its his way or NO WAY! he only likes one style writing (elementary short sentences) and if you do write in a scholarly manner than you r pretty much SCREWED! hes rude, obnoxious and biased. AVOID HIM!"
2113,average,"This is an easy, straightforward course as long as you stay awake during lectures. Brym is an extremely boring professor whose unfounded arrogance is sometimes appalling. However, the course material is easy to master. Textbook readings are key; Brym follows them closely during his lecture. All in all, its a course that isn't difficult."
3488,average,Pretty easy and fair class. Her study guides are extremely long though and there are a lot of material on the tests but they are not bad if you study. Do not need to get the textbook.
2979,average,Good as a person. Not good as a instructer
837,poor,"i took calc in hs, and like math, i found the class to be easy, but only cus i had an understanding in calc, i do not recomend cook and from what i heard about the other math teachers i dont recomend them either, cook is boring, old and doesnt teach, wish i could say something good, but nothing comes to mind"
2970,good,"He was really amazing, caring, and inspirational."
2008,good,Excellent. It does get a little boring after sitting in the lecture for two hours but overall one of the better professors.
4317,average,"Very nice man but senile.  There are always problems with his exams once we go over them as a class.  Students have literally brought the textbook out and said &quot;I put ____ as an answer because it is in the textbook and you marked it wrong&quot; but for Professor Dennis, it is his way or nothing.  VERY frusterating."
503,good,you don't even have to go to class.  EASY
2486,good,"Excellent and intelligent Professor. He is so clear during his lectures. Though Chemistry is not interesting, but he made it interesting."
3270,average,"Tough grader.  She likes to take points off for everything.  Even if you do the homework right, you'll lose points for layout or something.  Be careful to never use or look at any access database that is not yours.  She accuses a lot of students of cheating even when they haven't."
380,good,"He's a nice guy with a great sense of humor but his tests are hard...and he asks about questions like, what mating system do the Lake Erie water-snakes exhibit&#63; - if you didn't read those 2 sentences from a specific chapter in the book then you're going to get the question wrong."
4291,poor,"He is such a sweet man. His lectures were long and boring. I stopped attending after first exam. 3 exams, 3 quizzes all very easy if you read the book and truly understand. He gives a study guide but its very useless for his exam. He gives plenty extra credit and opportunity to pass. Would definitely take again."
1525,poor,i used to love math. i was really good at it.....but then i took this class...he writes down EVERY word he says and the class does absolutely nothing. I don't go to class at all anymore because if i do i just do sudoku or fall asleep...there is just no use anymore i would rather sleep an extra hour than go all across campus to the worst class ever!
3331,average,"The good: lectures are over quickly. The bad: lectures are over quickly. They usually end early, but you may not learn much. Most people (at least me) learned most of the stuff during the RCT, which were VERY helpful. The book helps out too. Quizzes and tests reflect the lectures, and tests are MC. Not the best prof. at GMU, but you'll be fine."
2636,poor,I am not a mean person but I can't help yelling that she SUCKS
2340,good,"Excellent prof, and the tests are easy if you study"
374,good,"Very nice person, will help you whenever you go to him. Makes class fun."
2531,good,"superb prof. easy going, very stylish"
2381,poor,"I totally don't understand why he is so hot on ""rate my professor"". Actually he is so terriable at teaching. Not half of the class will go to his lecture now. He teaches us nothing!! If the level of understanding of a concept is 10, he is teaching us negative 2! Worst prof ever. Don't like him."
3482,good,"Fondufe is the absolute best! Biology has never been my strongest subject, but she is so passionate about science and gives clear and effective analogies to help reinforce each subject. She's approachable and clearly very knowledgable about what she teaches. I would definitely recommend her, whether you're taking bio for a gen ed or a major req."
939,good,"She is the absolute best teacher in the Crim department. I wish she taught every class! Now if you want to actually learn and have fun learning, she is definitely the one to take!!!!!"
2988,good,"good prof, hes hilarious"
3542,poor,"She didn't help at all. She reads straight off from the powerpoint. Most of the time, I had to learn everything all by myself. Her exams are really hard. I wish I didn't pick her as my professor."
2147,good,I really liked the course I had with him and I found his lectures clear and easy to follow. I liked his style of teaching as well... overall very good prof and course!
2964,poor,He's BORING and CHILDISH
2068,good,"good teacher, easy, tests aren't too hard"
529,good,"she's an easy teacher...she wanted us to learn the greek alphabet and we asked her if we could learn it for extra credit and she agreed. She's cool, not a hard class at all...no tests all papers and no final or midterm :)"
3955,good,"Dr. Bauman is the best professor on the face of the earth! I loved her class so much, I'm taking her ARTH 360 class in the fall. I thought art history would be boring, but she made me love it. If you want an easy and fun way to fulfill your fine art requirement, take her! She's great. =]"
636,poor,"Terrible professor. I was making 5's on my developmental essays and as soon as I got into this class I failed every one of his essay's. Very confusing teacher, does not break things down and was terrible with communication. VERY HARD. The WORST professor I HAVE EVER HAD. NEVER take this class with him. poor experience!"
1269,good,"I enjoyed every minute I spent in this class. She encourages class participation but creates an atmosphere where you feel comfortable doing so. Grade is based on 4 exams, but one grade is dropped, and homework that is very manageable. Fantastic class with a fantastic professor."
185,good,Such a cool guy. He once told are class to sit in a dark room with our friends and talk about death. Lectures are interesting but the material can be challenging. He does post old exams to study from and reuses some questions but be careful because he'll reword them slightly to throw you off 
3320,poor,She is easily the worst teacher I have ever had and that is saying a lot.  Would not help you at all during class if you got stuck.  Would literally yell at you to &quot;figure it out&quot; if you asked a question.  The textbook is beyond useless and it took real world experience for me to figure out why I had to take this class.  Avoid her at all costs.
2772,poor,"monotonous, no clarity"
4035,good,good prof. not a bad person in person. his classes are hard but he does know his stuff. he is mean to the class but once you talk to him one on one with questions he will answer and explain it.
1797,good,"She has lecture notes written in which you have to fill in for every lecture, so you have to go to class every time. Her exams are mainly focused on class activities/videos. Her hw was fairly easy and helpful. Discussion available for 20 extra points."
1441,poor,"He is completely rude to his students. Makes comments that ""he is disappointed"" in the grades, and ""if you received below a certain grade don't bother showing up for the test, send someone else"". Frequently say's ""If you don't like it, I don't care"". Lectures are CONFUSING! Book he authored IS HORRIBLE (so many mistakes). AVOID!!"
2664,good,A very enthusiastic teacher that keeps course material interesting.  Tends to cover the basic concepts in class but not the details needed to well.  I did well by reading ahead of class and only going to classes when I felt like it.
1535,poor,Horrible. Avoid this class unless you have extra time to go to tutoring where you can actually learn something or if you can afford a zero figured in to your GPA.
1273,good,Incredibly funny and easy to understand. Lectures are fun and go by in an instance. Drops a ton of grades. Easy A!
607,good,"I enjoyed working with Mr. Everett.  His essays were very difficult for me.  He is available for assistance during his office hours.  I recommend taking advantage of his help if English is not your forte.  As long as you attend class, do your best on the assignments, and complete the assigned readings for quizzes you should pass."
1712,good,"for 128, cook does a decent job covering the material considering that it's a hard subject. much better than 127 with Rudvalis. sometimes difficult to see what it is he is talking about, but he will try and clarify if you ask him. I suggest going to the math help center, they take everything he sais in class and makes it easy to understand."
2199,good,Prof Brym is the best prof at U of T
955,good,I Absolutley looovveee this Professor. She is very helpful with assignments and understands that her class is not the most important one we are taking for the semester. She gives plenty of helpful hints for upcoming quizzes and exams and makes every class period the most enjoyable i have ever had in my whole college experience. I HIGHLY recommend:)
3022,poor,"this was hard cuz it was purely memory work.  rather than regurgitating his notes, he could have organized it in a more pedagogical manner... easier to generalize somehow.  his notes could use index or something."
3179,average,"This class can be difficult.  The grading criteria is straight forward. The final exam was very challenging but not too challenging that it was not passable. If you show up each week for the lecture, do the homework due for recitation, as well as the online portions you will get a good grade. You can always visit the accounting lab for extra help."
403,good,"Cool teacher, test questios are overly confusing, but you learn what you need to know."
2071,average,No Comments
4002,good,"Lyons gets a bad rap, but he is just the no non-sense type of professor. His default is treat everyone as a threat to course. But after he has made his direction for the class clear and everyone is on the same page things will improve. His assignments are not given to confuse students, but rather to teach them. His study guides are just everything."
1977,good,"Really easy class.  Went like twice and didn't even need to.  As long as you study the notes before the test you should be fine.  She added a weekly homework component, but it's really easy and takes like 2 seconds to do.  You only need a 90 average to get an A, so there's really no excuse to get any less than that."
158,poor,"I've gone to almost every class, sat in the front. Tried to pay attention to his lectures and I have yet to learn a single thing from this dude. He goes on random tangents about unrelated stuff and somehow it ends up on the test. His labs are easy and there is almost no homework in the class  but his lectures are a complete waste of time."
1748,poor,He's a nice guy but his lectures are all over the place and he seems to not know what he's talking about. His lectures are VERY unhelpful. If yoo've had clac before he's ok but if it's your first time taking calc avoid him at all costs.
2751,poor,No Comments
902,good,"Professor Christopher is amazing! She cares about her students success, and tries to connect the lectures to her life experiences which makes things fun to learn and easier to grasp. She's the reason I changed my major from business to crim and I suggest everyone to take all her classes. Take her class you will have fun and won't regret it!"
352,good,He is HILARIOUS the only reason i showed up to school is cuz i wanted to come to his lectures seriously he will make you laugh the whole lecture. good!!!
1230,good,"Should not teach intro bio, would be better at higher level courses."
4111,average,Hes rough but overall not as bad as people say. Just do the work study for the test overall its supposed be to a hard class. Will take attendence from time to time. Pop quizes are ridiculous but hey what can you do! JUST STUDY
2140,poor,read the textbook!!!!!!!!!!!!! his tests are hard but not totally impossible...this course is a difficult first year course that i recommend to those who are willing to work very hard! overall grade for Prof Brym: C
444,good,"Read the assigned reading ahead of time! Yes, it's hard but that's college. I heard so many people complain about him being impossible to pass, it's not impossible if you do what your supposed to. Definitely not an easy A, but there is not much work. Read chapters, a couple of online quizzes, handful of tests, final is open notebook."
4351,good,"This professor is very nice, but class is a big waste of time.  He gives the students the floor for half of the class to discuss whatever they want on certain topics/issues.  Some students may enjoy this, but I'd rather use that time at home to study for my other classes.  As long as you get the books and complete the study guides, you'll do well."
754,poor,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This class is by far the WORST class Ive ever taken at UMASS. He doesnt reply emails or put anything on Moodle. Lectures are the WORST in the entire universe and are useless. You really learn nothing but are required to know a ton of BS for the midterms. Its quite lovely... Dont take this class if you value your GPA!
1737,poor,"he is a horrible teacher...he knows the information but doesnt clarify it, never organized, always late, the test are WICKED HARD and TRICKY!! i hated that class!!"
4381,good,"Dennis is one of the nicest professors I have ever had.  He is a bit confusing at times, but what professor isn't.  He is lighthearted and doesn't intimidate his students.  I would recommend him to anyone who asked."
311,average,"Putting in more work does not always equate to a better grade, Molumby.. He likes to quip that if you are not getting the grade you want, you are not working hard enough. Know the phrase work smarter not harder&#63; Where things pay off is being able to digest, comprehend, and recall the concepts learned in lecture, lab, book, and probs. Review often."
548,poor,"Has her own crazy agenda for the class, unlike any other phl 100 class I've heard of.  Paper assignments are very vague, and hard to understand exactly what she wants from them."
3139,poor,I thank God each class for my laptop or I'd die.
3426,poor,She's an absolute 100% &lt;Insert assorted cuss words here&gt;
306,average,"I only missed one point out of all assignments/labs. that part was easy.  the tests, however...RIDICULOUS. he throws random facts in there and makes it way harder than the class actually is.  im a soph with a 3.9 and find classes that should be more challenging way easier than his class bc of his unfair tests. if i get a B in this class its such BS"
2335,good,""" YOU HAVE TO COME TO LECTURE AS IT WILL COVER THINGS THAT AREN""T COVERED IN THE"
694,good,Dr. Sacher is a wonderful professor!  She is organized and her assignments are fun and relevant.  Going to class was like getting free therapy!
2356,good,Was a great teacher and I understood all of the concepts that he taught. He makes sure that the class is engaged in the lecture. He does have hard tests though..
1927,good,Makes class interesting and fun
4267,average,"She got sucky towards the end. She started strong and gave good lectures, but towards the end of the year she started to drag onnnn everything. She is def. not hard to listen to, and her exams are really not that hard as long as you keep up in lab and read her slides. Pretty straight-forward."
749,poor,"Cook is a nice and funny guy, but his teaching can come up a little short. Goes off on tangents frequently and explains things a little more difficult than they have to be. I thought the material would be super easy since the first thing we did was antiderivatives for a good 2 weeks, but then ramped it up and it got very hard. The TA taught better."
2522,good,"he's very clear, entertaining (with prim gestures) and SO SEXY!!!"
1266,good,"One of the best professors I've had. Really interesting and really into her subject. You'll want to participate and ask questions. The class is pretty easy, especially because of all the ways to earn extra credit. Just don't forget to do the homework. Its a good idea to show up for class, but you'll probably want to anyways."
3431,average,Very hostile teacher whose means for transportation is probably the broomstick. In all fairness she will help you if you ask but don't ever leave class early she'll freak out.
3481,good,"Since this is rate my professor, Fondufe is a great. The class is not hard, i promise u that, but that doesn't mean slack; if u come to class (which u must cuz iclickers) &pay attention &take notes, u'll be golden. DONT FREAK OUT! If u don't, u can just go through the slides on ur own time. that is how i studied. she posts so much on blkb to help!"
4329,poor,going to class is a waste of time. his lectures do not cover any material in the book and he rambles on and on. terrible professor!!!!!
970,good,Professor Schurter is one of the best teachers I have ever had in my entire educational career. You leave his class having learned life skills that will actually help you in your career. His classes are highly engaging and interesting as well. Did I mention he cares about his students! I am honored and proud to have had him as my professor!
13,average,"She favors students with the same political views as her own. She does not hide the liberal bias in her class either. She is boring. She boasts about her doctorate in political science, too. Not a recommendable teacher."
873,good,He's a pretty funny dude in class but don't expect to learn anything....better get the book if you wanna do well....
808,poor,"He goes off in tangents.  He never solved problems completely out and he'd derive some equations and confuse you so much.  The lectures, OWLs, won't prepare you for the test. I got more help at the tutoring places than going to lecture all semester. But he's a nice guy though."
514,good,"I loved this class! If you want a good grade, show up at class and follow what he says very closely. If you pay attention, you probably wouldn't even need the lecture notes."
3789,poor,"Overall not a difficult class. If you want to get the answers to her lecture notes and study guides you MUST come to lecture.  If not, the lecture notes on line are ZERO help!  If you come to lecture you will get all the answers on the study guide by paying attention. Overall, easy A for a science grade just need to come to lecture!"
409,good,"he is by far the greatest teacher i've had at UIC. he has a passion for what he does and it shows during his lectures. i just went to his class, listened, didn't read the book and ended up getting a B.  the curve helped a lot of people & the class isn't even that hard!"
2648,poor,"I don't need her to read me the lecture slides - could do that by myself. She doesn't teach anything.  I haven't learnt anything from her.  Textbook was useful, as usual.  Yes, avoid her at all costs.  Her sarcasms and jokes aren't funny either."
3549,good,Nice teacher but a big class almost 180 students and even if you are in front sometimes she doesn't get to your question at all....
207,good,"He was a very clear professor, his tests were very predictable, though he Intentionally throws curve balls & he makes errors on tests so pay attention for more points! Only read the book if he stresses it, tests are mostly from lecture. Easy A he seems like he is very passionate but presses his atheistic views on the class wanted or not, that's bad"
2576,poor,"what she tought, is just on the book.."
458,poor,I would not recommend anyone to take this class with this professor. I regret taking it . You have been warned. Just don't do it.
4118,poor,He already hates you
2430,good,"&quot;By the virtue of the fact&quot; that he's a very hard prof, I dislike him greatly. I found it distracting when he would talk through his mic and his strut and hair flip didn't help much either. Miserable times :( I didn't know a thing on his chm138 exam :("
3295,poor,HARD CLASS. HARD FINAL. MY LIFE STINKS.
3442,average,I didn't like her and I would not take her again.  Her grading system sucks.  She doesn't give out -/+'s.
4043,poor,This guy is a sad individual. He reacts to valid questions from students by making them feel stupid. He is not very good at staying organized or making annoucements on blackboard in a timely manner. It took 5 weeks to return our midterms and we did not know the time of the final exam until less than 48 hours before the exam. LYONS is WORTHLESS!
3132,poor,"Hard to approach outside of class. His lectures are basically straight out of the textbook, which, by the way, he wrote and he forces you to buy (hw problems were assigned from book). Too many irrelevant tangents in class. Should've listened to the users below, avoid this teacher."
1883,good,No Comments
1713,poor,"He is completely unprepared for class.  He rushes in 10 minutes after the class is supposed to begin and just does some random problems out of the book that take him about 5 minutes to find.  He seems like his passion for the subject is gone because he does not motivate you to learn.  He is a nice man, just not a good professor."
3070,poor,"I would call him an inconsistent teacher at best. His lectures are poorly-paced, and he spends excessive amounts of time working through proofs of theorems that are unnecessary and irrelevant to the students' interest. He spends lots of time working through these very theory-heavy proofs, and then skimps on time spent on his actual lecture material"
2877,good,"Best professor I've ever had. Excellent, inspiring, amusing and captivating. I'd take the class over and over again just to attend his lectures"
552,good,Great Professor.  Very lively lectures and amazingly approachable.  He spent 1 hour with me trying to figure out what I wanted to major in.  Pushes chemistry a lot but obviously only because he loves it and thinks that it is beneficial to students.
1439,good,Very energetic and clear.  Makes psychology fun.  Tests are easy if you study and she gives lots of extra credit options.
2270,good,Has very interesting examples and knows how to teach the basics of sociology
4206,good,Her lectures are actually really interesting and are applicable to everyday work situations. The exams were really straight-forward and easy as long as you pay attention during lecture and read through the book some. The paper wasn't bad as long as you start early and look at the rubric closely. They have standard guidelines for you to follow.
1925,good,"I don't know about her other classes, but this one was straight lecture and BORING!  She seems like a very nice person though"
634,good,"Professor Everett is fair, demanding, and passionate. I enjoyed his class and learned a lot. Slackers beware: you must have a strong work ethic and not procrastinate."
4228,good,"I thought Prof. Wolf did a pretty good job with intro management. There's a lot to cover so she rushes through a lot of it. The lab is actually pretty good at reinforcing all the terms, models, charts, etc, etc. The exams are NOT hard. The answers were made so obvious and the study guides tell you what terms/models to look at."
316,good,"There seem to be a lot of mixed reviews but overall, Molumby is a good professor. He understands and takes a genuine interest in teaching this material.You should pay attention to his anecdotes in lecture because some exam questions come from them. Make sure you read the readings and study his lecture slides and you should get an A."
3337,average,"Not much to say really -- all SOM kids gotta take Hylton, so you'll just have to deal with it.  You can tell she's a real &quot;w&quot;itch -- during the last class one kid had his arms crossed/acted bored, Hylton freaked and just ended class right there with no review.  Tests aren't that hard, just read/attend class & lab and take notes of what she writes."
4137,average,"DO NOT TAKE LYONS, BIGGEST MISTAKE I HAVE EVER MADE. HIS PROJECT TOOK OVER 30 HRS TO FINISH NO LIE!!! TAKE ANY OTHER PROF OUT THERE....SO NOT WORTH IT!"
1328,good,good woman. Know her stuff. Makes it easy for you to know things also. Go to class and take notes outlined for you already and you'll get an A. Just study the notes.
427,good,"The material is hard, but just read the notes. Has lenient curve... 82.5%=A and is very laid back."
2622,average,"She's an okay lecturer, in the aspect that she can read off slides, but is sadly lacking when it comes to teaching the important concepts. She's nice, but doesn't prepare you very well. Take her only over Reed."
105,good,good teacher. Make sure you fill your CS requirement with Mehran.
142,good,"brilliant and interesting man, as well as kind.  very clear lecturer, extremely engaging."
2169,poor,"Terrible lectures, tearfully boring subject matter. I took this course as a mandatory social science credit because I didn't have to write essays for it. Brym has below average intelligence and struggles with the simple math required for things like interest calculations"
2588,poor,terrible teacher. cannot teach accounting. test was unfair.
3724,good,"- Like the other reviews have said, she's really nice and knows her stuff.   - You'll need to at least buy the online version of the textbook so you can have the access code for the online stuff and you'll also need to purchase a TopHat subscription inste"
2241,good,I have enjoyed professor bryms's class greatly.  The material and the way it is presented makes it a very interesting and enjoyable class.
2651,poor,"Her lectures are boring. The only way to learn is to read the book. By the way there is no way to pass her by (if you are taking MGT120), so get ready for destruction! I dont mind her attitude and personality, but she is not a good teacher."
2163,good,awsome class
1949,good,"Quizzes are easy and all MC. You also have a second chance to do it online at home, which counts as 25%. You will get an A if you tried just a bit. Final is optional. The course content is very interesting. She tries to be funny. She gives out extra credit during lecture just for attendance but that doesn't help much. Never used the textbook. "
1768,good,"lively class, explains the materials well."
2272,good,Prof. Brym has made learning about sociology fun and interesting. I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in learning about how the world works to take this course.
1,poor,"Dr. Hora is a talker, she does love it so. However, she is prone to soap box rants. Her teaching style did not resonate well with me. In the first month of class, there was no homework. She gave an exam before a single quiz was given. Students that have not taken her before were left behind because of this. For this reason, I can not recommend Hora"
3102,average,Weird guy. Wastes a lot of time on meaningless proofs and writes too quickly in general. Tests are not too difficult and the final is optional. The way the class is weighted it is almost impossible to get below a C and an easy B if you do good on HW and quizzes. Much better option than the other 256 teacher.
4360,good,"such a funnie little old man he reminds me of yoda hes pretty easy, but boring u'll fall asleep in class"
1951,good,"HAHAHHA this class was such a joke. i was terrible at bio in high school but she gives u the notes, optional final (which u won't need to take), drops lowest of 4 test grades (exams are so easy its not even funny), hws take 5 mins and ecs are so easy but in hindsight why would i ever do them). Just sign up now easiest A ever."
4125,poor,He does not help with anything. The course should be 400 level. He likes to control other section of IT 221.
4344,poor,"dr. dennis is the worst professor of all time! i changed majors because he was such a horrible professor. i got A's and B's in all of the other classes and i failed this class. don't major in sociology, and don't take his class."
3004,good,One of the best. Very smart. Great examples. Loves to teach the topic. Test are hard but very fair. Great to get you back on track with his motivational speeches.
1109,good,"tough teacher, good teacher, sense of humor, really wants students to suceed"
2792,poor,"Prof doesn't respect students at all, never ask any questions, he'll humiliate you"
591,good,long lectures but teaches well even though goes off topic at times
1695,average,"Thurlow is a nice man, but he simply cannot teach. Use the book and do the practice problems. You should still go to class though, he goes over problems."
2650,good,the &quot;break&quot; 1/2 way through wastes 30 mins of answering peoples' personal questions. she only covers 1/3 of the material in class so be prepared to study a lot on your own. going to tutorials will definately increase your mark.
1576,poor,avoid if all possible so unclear its unreal
3259,good,"I was fortunate enough to get an A in her class. All you needed was a 90 or better. I just read the book twice, did connect and all that, and worked the problems in the back when I felt comfortable. Second test was hardest, but that's it."
213,good,"Just wonderful. First day make sure to yell at him to turn up the volume on the microphone. Other than that it's a nice class. Adventure stories from otters, wasps, AIDS, and more. Just show up. All the answers to the tests are in the secret folder on blackboard surprised he never noticed (guess he just left it there for the lulz)."
778,poor,"Cook would be better off as a 1950's stand up comedian than a math prof. he doesnt explain ANYTHING and his &quot;examples&quot; in class are nothing like the ones on the exams. As far as technology goes, he has no idea what a computer is, and will constantly refer to it as &quot;the machine.&quot; Thank god i took calc in high school, or else i wouldve prob failed"
3383,good,"Professor Hylton constantly displays a positive attitude and really wants students to do well in her class. She is intelligent and her presentation of the subject matter clearly reflects it. Many of the students, however, are not prepared to actually put in the time and effort required to get a good grade. Overall, she is a great professor!!!!"
2918,good,"Took his SOC 327 & 382. Amazing professor, definitely the best Ive had in UofT. Lectures are very interesting, bringing in relevant material to add to text. genuinely cares for his students and gives you a chance to shine. try and join his work-study groups - that's where all the fun is.  Highly recommend this professor, and try and get to know him"
2043,good,Pretty easy class. If you go to most classes and study the packets you will do fine. It can be kinda boring but what class isn't! Shes very understanding and willing to help.
3901,good,I took this class as a freshman 4 years ago & still think she was one of my favorite/best professors at Mason! She is so passionate about art & so helpful. Definitely approach her for help & feedback; she's incredibly nice & helpful! It's a great class--you won't regret it! :)
2728,poor,"TOTALLY BORING! He reinvented monotonous! And he liked to test us on the most insignificant details. He's probably a brilliant man, but totally lacking public speaking skills"
3845,good,"A decent human being could not complain about anything for this course. Lisa Bauman is a very engaging lecturer so, preface: attendance is not mandatory but you will fail if you do not go. However, lecture is entertaining so you WANT to go! Would take again in an instant."
1567,good,"One of the most helpful professors I've ever had; along with reading and lectures, made Diff. Eqs. easy to understand; a little longwinded at times, but overall, a good, caring professor; definitely one of the best professors I've had."
3745,poor,Hardest 110 class i have ever taken! final semester senior and i actually thought i wouldn't make it! lectures are completely useless! keep track of doing the learning guides if you fall behind in filling them out then dont even think about continuing with the course. you have to put in a lot of effort into this class. DROP NOW!
4152,good,"I loved this class and I learned so much from him.  He's really tough, but it's not impossible to get an A in his class."
4299,average,"Reminds me so much of Morgan Freeman it's quite hilarious. His lectures can be boring but if you want to pass, bring a snack and attend lecture. He gives study guides but the tests are so tough that it doesn't matter anyways. Did not feel like a level 101 class. I'm still in the class. Heard he drops lowest test grades, we'll have to wait and see!"
4332,good,"great guy, so nice and sweet! class was super easy he let you take online quiz until you got a 100 and for inclass exams he gave you a study guide with exacly what was on exam."
1343,good,best professor ever. makes everything she covers REALLY easy. if you study for the exams you'll ace every single one. lots of oppurtunity for extra credit. don't waste ur money buying the book she gets all of her notes out of them and puts them on slides.
2013,good,"Judy's classes are interesting, especially some of the material.  She is soft spoken, which means the class can get restless.  Lot's of optional homework which most people end up doing anyways because it's helpful.  Tests were fair.  Some AV problems in class, which is a shame because it disrupts class.  I would recommend this class and teacher!"
273,poor,Extremely overrated professor. Is a poor lecturer who is difficult to understand (goes off on tangents like crazy) and gives really tricky exam questions. Avoid at all costs.
71,good,"Hi,Im Aravinth,from india,  I take this opportunity to thank Mr.Sahami for his extra-ordinary work and efforts in CS106A.,and thanks to the people who brought this great course out to the world to SEE.edu, and let other people to enjoy the finest education in the world. I have a Million thanks to sahami. he will make you like CS.:) great person :)"
1087,poor,"He's a pretty OK guy socially, but his teaching methods are pretty bland. Vague lectures in class, so the exams are unpredictable."
394,poor,Was a OK guy but his exams are hard tough expects u to know  what  is not  coververed if bio major than take the class
583,good,Very easy to follow and tests are quite fair.  Expects a lot but that is good!
1367,good,She is the best teacher I have had so far.  She makes everything so easy and has an amazing grading system where she drops the lowest grades of each category and provides lots of extra credit oppurtunities.
4387,poor,I dont like this professor. Students and EVEN FACULTY know he has a pathetic reputation. I failed his course and Im fighting to have my F removed from my transcript. Even smart kids were having problems. He just rambles on and makes no sense. AVOID HIM!
3168,average,"Connect homework very helpful on the exams. Also be sure to practice the multiple choice in the textbook and in LearnSmart, though I didn't find Learnsmart as helpful was still a decent study option and helped somewhat. Hylton is fast paced, but the lecture before the exams she tells you exactly what will be on the exam so be sure to go to those."
2548,good,What a sweetie.
3192,good,"Lectures on the powerpoints which can't be printed out in their entirety (can only printdownload certain pages). I made an A but put a lot of time into watching the online lectures, doing connect HW, doing connect quizzes, and watching Professor's lectures as well. It's an accounting class, so I didn't expect it to be a cake walk."
4212,good,Greatest ever Prof. Dr Wolf was the winner of &quot;teaching excellence award for 2007&quot; and she made this award &quot;prestigious&quot; by accepting it..../// and it is so regrettable that D and C grade students dare to use some 'negative and false' statements to hide their inabilities and lack intelligence or lack of efforts.
3098,good,"Pretty funny guy, makes calculus fun (or as fun as it can be) with jokes and his general quirkiness. Using the TAs and textbooks will really help; tests aren't too bad as long as you study and know the material. He doesn't grade too hard, our final was curved."
2749,good,"interesting course made dull, thanks to Mac ow"
1763,poor,He doesn't really help you learn.  Shouldn't rely on him to help you pass tests.  Expects you to know a lot more than he's covered.  But still a guy that keeps the lecture lively.
3567,average,"VERY ENERGETIC PROFESSOR. CLASS ATTENDANCE IS NOT MANDATORY BUT STUDY THE ONLINE SLIDES AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE, BUT THERE AREA ABOUT 45 SLIDES PER CHAPTER...SO NO SLACKING...TESTS ARE NOT A WALK IN THE PARK EITHER"
1259,good,"One of the most interesting classes I've taken.  There are a lot of notes to take but she gives outlines to fill in, so go to class, the exams (4 total, lowest score dropped) are pulled directly from the notes.  There are ""pop quizzes"" which are one question about the reading from the night before, the chapters are very easy reads. Fun class."
3889,good,"You should be so lucky to have Bauman as a professor. She is the best prf at GMU. She is fair, she is fun and she will work just as hard as she asks you to. She encourages intellectual discovery in art history, nurtures your ideas until they become meaningful to you. Your research will be your passion."
2253,average,GOod Professor but EXTREMELY rude and arrogant. He insulted a cab driver in front of 1500 people when I took this course four years ago.
526,poor,Worst teacher I have ever had.  Treats you like a child; gives you busy work.  You have to turn in your NOTES to get graded.  Going to this class literally made my head hurt.
377,good,Really good teacher...highly recom. Very helpful. Really wants students to do well...doesnt give extra credit but if class isnt doing well puts extra questions on exams which reallllly helps....No curve but makes sure that in the end...students EARN average grade of about a B
1559,poor,He is the worst teacher i have ever had. He makes things more complicated than they are and you end up having to teach yourself all of the material from class.
3606,good,Honestly is a nice woman and really tries to get you interested in the subject.  Makes things easy to understand but i took her in  the morning so always fell asleep.  Over all she is a good teacher.  tests however are not always on what she says.  they can be random and hard and specific.  MUST STUDY TEXTBOOK! its a hard class if you don't read.
1963,good,"Best class ever. She is the sweetest person and truly enjoys teaching biology. She will do everything in her power to make sure you recive the highest grade possible. Her final is optional and she counts 3/4 exams (dropping the lowest). The class is 90% exams, 10% homework but she offers a ton of extra credit. Def take it for a BS!"
4167,average,"This class is a joke. Her monotone online lectures stink, but the tests are pretty easy. My TA was good and an easy grader, but I've heard some of the other TA's make it much harder for you. You won't learn anything, but at least this class will boost your GPA."
348,good,"I liked him alot, he was very approachable and everything was easy except for the exams. I wish he would have given a study guide or something, because you just never knew what to expect in Molumby's class."
3785,good,"Yes, the person below me is correct.  I took her class this summer and found all of her notes filled out completely.  If you google her, you can find this information, and thus you never have to go to lecture.  Lab is required.  Tests are easy, especially if you google the notes like I said.  Labs are completion graded.  Got an 'A,' good professor."
2246,good,"He is clear, straightforward, modern, and in touch with his students. His lectures are now fair and informing. GO BRYM GO"
3945,good,"My favorite professor in the 3 years I've attended GMU. Exams were easy, 2x papers limited to 2 pages double spaced, attendance highly recommended. Unless you have a friend who will share notes with you you should go to class. She made MWF 8:30-9:20AM classes worth it. If you call her Mrs. Bauman prepare to have a pissed off Italian to deal with."
1709,poor,"This teacher is terrible. He's a good guy, and wants everyone to do well, but his lectures are completely useless. It's hard to get an A because his exams only contain 14 questions meaning you can only afford to get one wrong on each exam. His final was nothing like he said it would be. Most questions we had never even seen before. TERRIBLE."
1050,good,Extremely interesting class.  He is some what hard to follow at the beginning of the semester but once you get used to it then it isn't hard.  His office hours and reviews are extremely helpful and almost necessary.  He wants the you to learn and will help make sure they know what they need to know as long as they reach out for help. Real good guy.
590,good,"This class was extremely interesting and fun. It did require lots of note taking and you had to make sure you did everything on time, but that is typical of any college class. He is super helpful and gives you everything you need to know plus more, and this made the class seem less scary. Probably my favorite class I've ever taken!!"
519,good,"Great class...very interesting. He's very helpful, funny, and nice."
3821,good,"she does the best she can in a gen. ed. science class of more than 250 people. she wants everyone to do well, but it is hard to personally help that many people. i learned alot from her. you have to study hard for the tests and ace lab."
3208,good,"She is not that bad, she really does care about her students doing well. I had no idea what to expect in regards to accounting before this class but it is TOUGH. Recitation was very helpful, the TA would go over practice problems and show you how to solve them. I used the textbook often and would go back to it for reference. Study Study Study!"
2477,good,"Prof. Browning is definitely not &quot;plain old vanilla.&quot; Must say, fantastic prof, fair tests that really reflect your knowledge, etc. Definitely my favourite chem prof ever. But he looks like George McFly from Back to the Future, end of story."
1083,poor,"Very vague, did not give you your grades, unclear about everything, tests were all based on logic, and left us all in the dark. Did I mention he was nebulous&#63; poor professor, don't take him by any means - I still have no idea on what my grade is and the semester's over..."
2793,average,"All this guy likes to emphasize is theory. I know STA257 may be a theoretical course, but the amount of theory this guy emphasizes is nuts. For the tests, all you do is just memorize the techniques for proofs, do proofs, and get your 100."
4203,poor,"The class itself is very easy, but I don't understand why we need someone to read the PPT slides. This is almost a self-study course. She tends to pass her responsibilities to someone else such as lab instructors and other directors. It seems like she has no responsibility at all."
3846,good,Attendance isn't mandatory but she does not post to Blackboard so GO TO CLASS. I'd never taken an art class in my life but still managed A's on every exam. The museum field guide assignment is basically a guaranteed A if you put a little effort into it. Dr. Bauman was literally an angel and I loved her and the class to pieces!!
1294,good,"Such a great professor! Truely one of my favorites. Class was entertaining and tests were easy if you study the notes. Book isn't really necessary. Overall, easy A and a great class"
1809,good,"for a 9am class, susan kept it entertaining because she's slightly crazy, has a ton of energy, and is passionate about psych. she is a really good teacher & very well prepared for class. the class is pretty easy although you do have to attend because her exams are mostly all about the stuff she goes over in class,not from the book. i recommend her"
791,poor,"Thurlow is the bomb. Unfortunately he is a terrible teacher. He means well and loves the subject, but he lectures in class about things not on the test and he just about never spends time on actual material. He also has no clue how to use anything made in my lifetime."
792,poor,"Guy is a terrible teacher. He just gets up to the board and writes down random stuff doesn't really go over it very well. Uses WileyPlus which is $50 and you need to buy it because thats where the homework is, and wiley sucks doesn't help you learn at all. I like math have a B but this class is so bad do not take it with him. Exams sucked"
3319,good,"Accounting at George Mason is crazy!!  It's hard, but it is worth it in the long run.  Applying to the grad program soon and hopefully will be challenged at this level."
1980,good,"Let me tell you one thing, Judy Goodenough is the best kept secret at UMass. She is the kindest, sweetest, funniest, cutest professor I have had thus far. She is too nice for her own good and makes class fun and interesting. They call her &quot;Goodenough&quot; because no other teacher is Goodenough after taking this class.      (easy A, use lecture notes)"
3566,poor,You do not need the book in this class. The whole class is based off notes. Study notes and you will be fine. Attendance is not required. VERY boring speaker though... I can't even remember how many people fell asleep during her lectures.
2630,good,"She doesn't teach as well as other profs, but she does answer questions and e-mails very well. She helps out a lot. I think that most people do badly in the course is becasue they haven't taken accounting beforehand...but otherwise, she's an alright prof."
1530,poor,"Although extreamly smart, this professor is ZERO percent helpfull! I learned absolutely nothing from going to class. Be prepared to go to the learning center if you don't already know the material. Tests are really easy and straight foward, anyone could do it with little work. Owls are reopened before tests, which is nice."
1410,good,you MUST take at least one class with her. its just worth it.
3459,average,"She's a very nice professor. But the content itself killed me. The only grades for the class are 4 Tests, and the occasional quiz. But quizzes are only worth 5% while the tests are worth 70%.  If you know your BIO, go for it. If you dont, she's not the professor to take."
3755,good,"Dr. Largen is a great professor. She does go off in stories a lot but she is  REALLY easy. You really do not have to go to class, you can just read da book. But if you go to class you, do not need the book. I encourage you to go to as many extra credit assignment as possible, it really helps you grade. Take her if u want an easy A ;-)"
83,good,simplyAmazing
3717,good,"Going to lecture is helpful, lab can be very annoying with all the lab write ups. Just practice her questions from the powerpoint, and you are pretty much golden for the tests. Lecture does have tophat which is like an iclicker but she only counts like 75 out of the 125 possible points "
2350,good,Absolutely great professor!
20,poor,The tests are hard especially if you aren't interested. YOU NEED TO DO READINGS!!! Most of the quiz questions are from the chapter reviews. I thought I was going to get a D since I did bad on most tests but i ended with a decent grade so i can't complain. you NEED to go to class.
2661,poor,Doesn't know how to teach.  Her lectures are a waste of time.  The tests are difficult.  Best thing is to find yourself an accounting tutor because don't expect to learn much from class.
1562,poor,No Comments
973,good,"Genuine interest in success of his students. Always willing to offer additional help to anyone in need. ""Coffee hours"" outside of class time for extra resume help, etcetera. Excellent rapport with students. I recommend taking his class!"
1710,good,"While most people in this class dont enjoy the subject, he does a good job explaining an otherwise boring subject. You need to go to class, but as long as you do, you will do well on the exams."
3085,good,Took 21-127. Topology is hard but all the questions he gave us are pretty standard
1098,good,"You Will Either hate or like Randy. I found him to be very easy. Class is basically about diagrams he puts up in class. Tests will be modified/combined versions of those diagrams. So as long as you know the diagrams inside and out, you'll be fine. Test format of multiple true/false makes it even easier. Go to class, dont even need to read textbook."
3262,good,"Even though this class is not the easiest, prof hylton makes it easy to understand. Her class was clear and concise, and she repeats things so many times it's hard not to get the concept. Her policy on cell phones and laptops is strict, but understandable, if you're not going to pay attention why come to class in the first place&#63;"
886,average,"Cool guy, but kind of monotone."
2860,poor,No Comments
3964,good,"Professor Bauman was amazing! So energetic about the topic! You do have to know the stories/myths to do well in this class, but the way she lectures, she actually keeps you interested! Highly recommended."
3657,good,"Fondufe is adorable:) It is absolutely imperative that you absorb  everything in the powerpoint slides that she posts; they are the key to success on her exams. DO NOT be fooled by some of the other ratings on here.  Although I did get an A in the class, I did so because I studied intensively for each exam; this class is hard, but not impossible."
3994,average,"I've really started to not enjoy his lectures. At first I thought he was going to be the best professor I've ever had, and for the most part he's very professional, but he talks about numerous topics that aren't that specific to Security WAY to in depth. He's definitely smart, I just wish he was smart enough to focus on what matters for IT Security"
737,good,"He is the nicest person. His lectures are really amazing , inspired me to study Math. This is not a high school , I believe he is a great teacher."
1453,poor,"If you don't already know the stuff, you're screwed. Try teaching yourself from the book or going to the SI sessions. If you already know the stuff, don't bother going to class."
3077,good,I actually think he's a pretty good professor. 
4138,average,"If you are looking between Lyons and Islam, be smart and choose Islam. The test Lyon's give are short answer, essay, etc. Never multiple choice, unless he is feeling lazy. Case Studies are like quizes, work alone and closed book. He can be helpful if you see him in his office.  He's very moody!"
2506,good,"mmmmmmmm........  My fav prof at U of T BY FAR (and I'm in third year!!!)  So beeeeuuuutiful and sweet, funny, sexy....mmmmm I named my fish after this babe!~"
2126,good,extremely important to do readings and make notes - saves a lot of time and energy before soc tests and bound to do well. prof was amazing lecturer - very organized and good use of powerpoints. extremely knowledgeable about material and engaging. great class for 1st years!
906,good,"I took this class online, so I can't comment on what lectures are like in this class. However, Professor Christopher was very helpful and responds to emails pretty quickly. The workload in this class was moderately heavy, and the exam is tough. But overall, if you work hard and study, she'll give you an A."
2840,poor,the worst prof in history
3478,good,"She's really nice and enthusiastic. Her lectures do tend to lag on, though. She provides study guides and powerpoints. However, there is A LOT of content to study for each test. You need to put in the time to study everything. However, as long as you study for the tests, you should be fine."
2507,good,yum!!  oh and smart too.  prof. browning is the best prof ever!!
2428,good,he's only an ok lecturer i have to admit..but true..like everybody says here..he IS hot~ also he's only good at organic chm but definitely not physical chm!
947,good,"I'm surprised that she doesn't have more comments because she is truly the best teacher at west ga. In all honesty, she is the best teacher I've ever had in all my schooling. I was always excited about coming to her class everyday. And the discussions were soo much fun and sometimes heated. Take this class!! I got an A."
2954,good,"Took his class 2 summers ago. In 4 months,we did more reading than the class that runs for twice as long in the fall/winter terms. Course reader (rough copy his unpublished book, errors & all) was expensive. But Tepperman was very approachable & helpful."
3153,good,"This was my second time taking this class. I originally took it with Mark Chase and didn't pass by 1 point. You have to go to every class, the handouts she gives you is on the exams and she points out what you need to know. She'll pass you as long as she knows you care about trying to learn it and pass. It's a tough class, but she cares about you."
715,good,"Professor Sacher is the funniest and one of the best teachers I have had so far at MSU.  She makes the class discussions interesting and she cares about her students.  The course consists of journal entires, 1 group project, midterm, and a final."
3142,poor,"What kind of calculus professor is so lazy that he doesn't use the chalkboard&#63; Be serious, slides&#63;! And I paid HOW MUCH for this&#63;! No matter what he says he's not interested in teaching."
686,good,"She is not your average Professor! =) She is amazing and you will become attach to the class.We have a page journal due every week, mid-term, and a group project.You shouldn't have a problem in getting an A.You will learn many real life things and it is like class therapy!She is real good and I'll take her again without a doubt!"
4047,good,What people don't realize is that IT 223 is the security concentration weed-out course. It's a pain in the neck because it has to be. Lyons (as one of Mason's most prestigious professors) is obligated to make sure that people who go into the security concentration are people who will actually care to know the material and not screw up in real life.
2353,good,AVE PROF
2257,poor,"Egotistical, rude, and unhelpful. Tests less about knowing the material and more about tricking the students."
3489,good,"Tests aren't bad - if you study the powerpoint lectures, you will be fine. She goes into a lot of (unnecessary) detail during her lectures though and fell behind the course syllabus pretty significantly. Fondufe is genuinely nice and cares about her students doing well. "
21,poor,Boring lectures. Can't directly answer a question. Makes sure you know she is DOCTOR Hora. I emailed her with a question about a paper and I am still waiting for a response almost 2 months later. Completely unhelpful.
885,good,he was the best calc teacher ever
3610,poor,"Teacher:  Very nice woman who's really passionate & enthusiastic about bio. Likes to dance while she teaches.  Problem is, she goes off into tangents on info we don't need to know .. can be confusing.  sometimes screeches. Advice: read textbook & study slides.  Tests very specific.  going to class not necessary if u study. save old tests for final."
917,good,"I think she is definitely the best professor I've had at UWG so far. She keeps you  intrigued with her personal stories and opinions on the matter at hand. If you're interested in Criminology at all, take a class she's teaching! You won't regret it! "
2916,good,"He's really straight forward with his ideas, and so are his exams. Its always fun to listen to mustache jokes in class"
3248,good,The class overall is very challenging. She really iterates whats going to be on the exams &(in my opinion) thought she was a fair teacher. Hard to get an A but that just cause its ACCT. Make sure you go to lab! ((3 exams/comprehensive final/online hw & quizzes))
3927,good,"Good teacher. Pretty easy class. Attendance is mandatory but you get a couple of free passes, so you could get extra credit just for being there every class. Tests are pretty easy if you come to class, take good notes, and study. Also, do the readings. There are always questions on the reading and you usually don't cover them in class."
2984,good,"best prof ever. Always encourages you, 5% bonus on tests, easiest 4.0 ever"
1265,good,"Professor Rahhal always made me want to go to class.  Every lecture was interesting and fun. She sometimes has class experiments, shows video clips, and always gives helpful examples.  There are 6 reading quizzes in class and quizzes online. Sometimes may seem like a lot of work, but its never hard. I would take this again."
483,good,"LOVED this class. take him for anth 045, it's the easiest class he teaches and you will love him for it. he is absolutely hilarious and makes you never want to miss a minute of his class. grade is based on only 4 tests (directly from study guide) and obviously if you don't go to class or read the book you won't do well. doesn't take attendance"
3543,good,"Dr. Fondufe rocks. She explains all the concepts very thoroughly with a great deal of clarity and enthusiasm. Her exams are also very easy and straightforward, ESPECIALLY relative to the other cell bio professors. Just paying attention and going over her slides is enough to get you an A with relative ease."
1219,good,He's the man! #1
277,average,"hes very good at lecturing however he expects you to know EVERY word of all of the 150 slide presentations. His exam questions are EXTREMELY tricky, you really need to know your stuff to do well."
988,good,"Randy is a great professor and wants you to do well in his class. He challenges you, which some People don't like, but he has taught me a lot and has an amazing personality."
2084,good,No Comments
1245,good,"One of the best classes I've ever taken at UMass. Tammy loves teaching and gives fantastic lectures. She tells stories and sometimes rewards you with candy for participation. The exams aren't hard - read the textbook the night before and you will do fine. She only counts 3 out of the 4 exams, so do well and you can skip the final."
2382,good,"I don't understand what people are saying. That first midterm was really easy if you read the questions carefully. In my opinion, the best professor out of the three that I had."
571,good,Hard exam and tests!
1435,good,"good professor, the class is a lot of fun!!"
993,good,"I love Randy! Randy is not rude/ not unhelpful whatsoever, his class is extremely difficult and requires a lot of outside work and reading, but he is always prepared to answer your question. He holds review sessions (be grateful, not all college professors do this) and his exams are True/ False and can be confusing but it sets you up for BIO152"
2685,good,No Comments
3651,poor,No Comments
585,good,"Nice lecture notes, good at explaining."
2848,poor,"Course mark distribution reflect those who have time to memorize old exams and those who do not. If this appeals to you, take this course. Some people I know have acheived high 90s in this course and told me they learned nothing."
2514,good,"um...ah.... very good lecturer. um... ah... questions&#63; concerns&#63; well, okay then.. let's move on shall we&#63;"
1349,good,Loved this class! The class moves at a good pace and Tammy includes stories about her twins (cutest kids!) as well as videos and interactive things to better understand the material. OWLs and SWAs help boost your grade and the exams aren't too hard.
1007,average,"Randy is a great guy, but he is not always very clear. The material he explains is good and easy to follow, but he loves clicker questions which he then fails to tell you the exact answer to. His tests are all T/F, but can be tricky. Randy loves cell signaling and cancer so be ready to have all examples revolve around those topics. "
674,good,"This isn't high school. Expect to write papers! Expect for things to move along quickly and if you fall behind, this class can become difficult. Do the reading, come to class, and make a block of time to write your assignments each week. Dont procrastinate! Everett is fair and doesnt really care what side you choose, just support it! Recommend."
2412,good,"funny lectures. clear notes. confusing tests... i mean, the questions themselves aren't that hard if you know what he is asking for. but his wording is &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;. overally, good prof. :)"
447,average,"i loved his class! he is the funniest teacher i had here. the material itself isn't very interesting, but he made it fun and i actually looked forward to going to his class in the morning. he made it easy to listen to his lectures-i actually paid attention. he does not like cell phones-never take yours out during class. i would def take him again"
2702,good,"One of my favourite professors in physiology. His lectures are clear an easy to follow. Very nice person, if you talk to him. The fact that he loves what he teaches sparks interest in his students. His tests are reasonable, if you think that his lectures are boring/hard - neurophysiology is not for you; tests on subject as complicated as this can't"
3548,average,"Very nice teacher, somewhat helpful, but the class itself was easy if you sat in class and listen,and skimmed through the textbook. Sometimes though the professor was all over the place with the lecture so you had to pay really good attention to follow."
2064,good,"Good professor, easy class"
3750,good,"Sweetest, nicest, funniest  professor you will ever take.  Classes are interesting and not too hard.  Tests are relatively easy.  There is some busywork from lab but it is worth it because she is good."
3336,good,"This class was ***** hard. I spent hours doing the assignments and project. I did good on the assignments but I still did not do well in the class. I have all As and Bs for the other classes, and I am really ticked off because this class is going to be an elective for me! She did tell some interesting stories though and that book wasn't good."
1690,poor,"Ridiculous professor. He never teaches the material--instead, he goes on about some obscure, random fact you never have to think about again. Only assigned like 5 OWLs that were extremely hard and nothing like the exams. Avoid this class if possible, if required for a major I'd say take it honors with Adena."
3911,good,She is so interesting and lively. she adjusts the class to the students' needs. She is a perfectionist. This class is manageable and it is easy to get an A with a moderate amount of effort.
1247,good,Lecture is worth waking up for. The material is easy to understand and Professor Rahhal makes it interesting. She is funny and gives examples that are easy to remember and relate to. She can be a bit sassy so don't piss her off in class.
1985,good,This class was easy because you dont need to go to lecture.  The lecture notes provide everything you need to pass the test but you do need to study them. The book is not used so dont waste your money on it.
294,good,"Great class. Look at past exams and memorize the slides if you want to pass the exams. Labs are very easy. There are 3 problems sets and lab reports too, but they are all easy. Very cool guy, gonna miss this class."
1547,poor,No Comments
2012,good,"I hated science but this class was good! She is hilarious and is just funny to listen to during her lectures. You don't need the textbook at all. Buy the notes or print them out then you just follow along. The tests are based mostly on the notes, some on lecture. There are plenty of opportunities for extra credit, even just for showing up."
588,average,all notes are on the net... teaches nothing else... not very helpful... does cool experiments in class... dry humor
2403,average,chemistry has always been a hard subject for me. Too many wanna be doctor in the course.
2129,good,Brym is definitely one of my favorite profs :)
3626,good,"Best bio teacher probably at mason.She's very nice. If you have questions during the exam, ask her and she will help u by giving explanations which hint towards the correct answer so don't be intimidated  to ask at all. All information comes from the textbook so its not random. No quizzes,No hw.  Tests = 50 questions. Try to get old exams. Take her"
3752,good,"Very simple and straightforward class. iClickers are used for an &quot;attendance&quot; grade, but attendance is not mandatory. Book isn't used  at all. Lab is the toughest part of the course for sure. She posts all power points online and even gives you a study guide for all the tests. Come to class, take notes, do the study guides and you'll be golden"
425,average,nice.
2582,good,I think Zuliani is pretty kewl prof. She teaches accounting and doesn't afraid of anything.
1054,good,"Great class. good prof, he brought food for us! Three big papers (team papers), but the guidelines were loose so we could do whatever we wanted as long as we put a lot of effort in. Also took intro bio with this prof, unconventional teaching style but much more interesting than your typical 'read 40 pages and memorize the bolded words' bio class"
3944,good,"Dr Bauman is the BEST teacher I've had at gmu. All around amazing person,amazing lectures, learned so much + learn about life and just living it to the fullest. extremely helpful and fair grader. as long as you attend class and do work you will do well. Also, if you want her to look over your notes she will and she will fill in spots/correct errors"
556,good,A+
3575,good,shes very nice. she tries to explain everything but her lectures can be boring.she has i-click quizes.does not curve that much. you have to understand the material as well memorizing it if you want a good grade.her tests are not easy.you need to read the book to understand and memorize her lecture. she has a comprehensive final
3071,poor,"Flaherty is a very decent professor you'll meet. The lectures are decent and helpful but you can get the same knowledge by reading the textbook. The homework is alright but he gives WebAssigns Friday mornings that are due Friday nights. His voice a lullaby and he makes bad jokes in class. You'll be fine, but you don't need to show up to do well."
4150,good,"I thought he was very fair- Even though he scares you to death that you dont think you are going to pass, he curves fairly. He's class is not one to slack off in! Do the homework and go to class or take another teacher!"
3859,good,"Wow finally an Old School Teacher who doesn't let students surf the web while in class!. She is there to teach and does it well. If you hate art no problem you will still learn and have fun doing it. She will change your mind. Take notes, have fun and no worries there. Go over the study guides!"
4148,poor,The guy gets his jollies off making fun of 20 year old's and has a tendancy to single people out. I would gladly love to punch him across the head just to make me feel better and doesn't deserve to teach at George Mason. He is very unclear in teaching and I hope to never see him again...
4369,poor,"Ya, very uncooperative and tests don't match class...."
1193,good,He is such a good professor. He keeps you awake by asking questions throughout class and is pretty cool about things
1716,poor,"I never went.. i got a C+. His class was pointless because he just confussed you and showed up late every time. So i stopped going, the cheat sheet tehy allow you to use on the tests really helped me. Just put examples from owls on it and you will be fine."
2604,good,"U idiots in mgt120 should stop complaining and study....Zuliani is the best accounting prof at U of T and if u try hard, attend class, tests are easy..."
3213,good,"She is tough but offers help if you ask for it. Always go to class and recitation. Use the book, her online lectures, ppt slides, online homework and quizzes for help. Tutors are available. You can do well in this class if you try."
1704,average,class is hard but calc 2 is hard. he goes on tangents in class irrelevant to anything. buy the book
2618,good,"she is a nice lady. material seems easy however when confronted on a test, pray that your guesses were correct"
2400,average,"the guy is a genius but he's also hard as hell. i hear so many ppl saying &quot;i was great in high school but did horrible here&quot;..well its time for you to wake up, all of the profs in chm138 and 139 are super challenging. people hate browning (and other uoft chem profs) but if you truly love chem you'll appreciate these professors as well."
2139,poor,I refuse to study from a chart of data issued fifteen years ago. Professor Brym is the equivalent to American Fox News; overly dramatic anecdotes mixed in with questionable facts and a delusional sense of self. The fact that he has won a teaching award this year is laughable. I could hear snoring from the balconies of Convocation Hall every class.
2383,poor,He is ok but typical of a prof at this school... great at presenting high school content and expects you to magically understand complex problems for the tests.  More accountablity is needed
2907,poor,Useless prof. Useless lectures. Useless course. I'm an Engineering student and I feel engineering courses are way easier than this course. Social Inequalities. Tepperman. What a joke. btw the class average was ~64 BEFORE the exam.
1285,good,Amazing teacher!! Keeps every single class interesting enough. Has extremely clear and organized notes. Also has a lenient grading policy which she drops the lowest grades and gives you credit for just putting your name on her in class assignments.
3347,average,"I don't think Professor Hylton is bad at all. I struggled keeping up with the fast lectures at first, but if you print out the lecture notes first, it helps a lot. Pay attention to lectures, as sometimes questions come from stories she tells, etc. Come to class on time though, she'll call you out."
2980,good,"Great teacher, enjoyed lecture, made going to a course that I originally had only a mild interest in into one that I constantly looked forward to, sometimes hard to understand, realistic about student and student life in university, very knowledgeable, would recommend"
3784,good,Great professor. She explains concepts very well and reinforces them with examples. Tests are easy as long as one listens to the lecture. Lab is easy as long as the work is completed. The class is great and you learn many interesting facts about the environment.
2087,good,"His lectures are well-prepared and though the subject matter is a bit dull, he usually offers some really interesting insights on it that make you think a little harder than Caron's lectures do. I actually really enjoyed reading his mini-textbook , which you definitely need to read thoroughly for his questions on the tests."
1889,good,"Great teacher. She has a good sense of humor which makes the class go by fast. No papers, but attendance is taken."
1591,poor,"Worst class i ever took. He writes down everyword he says, and doesn't explain or teach anything. In class he shows the problems that are already explained in the book, and doesn't know how to answer the questions given by students. He's also rude."
1346,good,"Tammy is a great teacher, i never missed one class of hers! She makes it VERy interesting and has a great personality which makes listening to her easy. HIGHLY recommend taking a class with her!"
2162,good,very interesting!!
2396,good,"Really good lecturer...but if only he stuck to lectures! His tests are hard as hell, mainly because its a little hard to undershand what he's looking for. It is possible to do well in his class but only if you know the material thoroughly. As in you shouldn't be unclear on ANYTHING."
2836,average,very hard course and prof makes it harder
2271,good,He's a really good professor and the lectures are really interesting.
3817,poor,This class was fun and easy in the fall but now it has gone down hill. She's starting to treat us like middle schoolers and she's making it harder to pass her tests by limiting the notes she sends out. Labs are pointless now; we do about 4 labs per lab day so in the end you don't learn anything.
1137,average,"Must go to class-he uses PRS which counts as part of ur grade/attendance.Great guy, but his teaching methods & the material are just *ick*. He likes giving &quot;surprises&quot; w/ the material.He's cool though."
3020,poor,this is by far the STUPIDEST COURSE i've taken at uoft.....they should get rid of this dumb course for good!  the prof is so disorganized and he thinks we are all memorization robots
972,good,"Schurter = BOSS. Genuinely nice guy, really cares about helping his students, has relevant material for lectures, and group projects are helpful. Impossible to do poorly since you can meet him at Newman Cafe almost any morning and eat/chat with him. Take his section and you won't regret it. Chocolat is a slow movie, though, and you will watch it."
795,good,"A great guy, sort of a funny but quirky sense of humor. He likes to teach the concepts and what's behind them rather than teaching you step-by-step processes, making it a little more difficult. You do a lot of self-teaching using the book and HW. Extremely clear! I loved how he went over things a few times until everyone understood. Doesn't EMail."
1711,poor,"This guy is terrible, and completely incompetant.  He is unprepared for class not to mention 10 minutes late every class period.  You actually get about 25 minutes of bad teaching in the 50 minute block.  He is rediculously bad at explaining the material and should be banished from teaching."
3915,good,By far the best teacher I've had a Mason. The one class i enjoyed going to and she made Art History easy to learn and kind of interesting. Recommend for anyone.
453,poor,One of the worst professors I've ever had. His exams are extremely hard and don't relate to his online slides or lecture notes. He is also unhelpful and his extra credit is useless. His typical class average is a low C. I wouldn't recommend anyone taking his class AT ALL!
913,good,"I plan on taking her courses again. Extremely clear expectations, valuable feedback, excellent participation. Hard to find online teachers that can keep up with short term courses, and she excels. Respectful and positive. This is the professor to take if you are or want to remain excited in the field of sociology or criminology."
3163,poor,No. Just no. She is really rude and mean to students during lectures. Have a question? Don't ask her because she will legit call you out and sass you. Don't even bother going to lecture because it will just make you feel like you're on the verge of a mental breakdown with how many times you'll roll your eyes. Just read the textbook and you'll pass.
1199,good,"He's the best!  Very helpful, actually wants you to pass his class and learn something.  I can't wait to have him again for 283!"
1274,good,Great professor.  Work is extremely easy along with easy exams.  Only need a 610 on quizzes for 100 so thats that... Recommend taking 100%
2375,good,"Browning is a good prof. Lectures were clear and very useful. A lot of people complain about the difficulty of the midterms but, if you did the textbook questions, and put in work outside of lecture it was okay. Overall enjoyed him as a chem professor."
37,poor,"NIce woman, but grades in an extremely biased fashion. Teaches a 100 level course as if all students were poly sci majors. I've gotten  As in 400 level honors classes, but only managed a C in Hora's class... that should say something."
974,good,Such a nice guy. Did not mind going to class early. Knew your name and always had a smile on face. TAKE JR WRITING WITH HIM and you will not regret it
983,good,"If you pay attention, you will love this class. You need to go to class to learn the material and iClicker, but he gives you 2 or 3 ""freebies"" if you miss class with clicker. Kind of funny, exams are multiple true/false. Quizzes every Friday."
3155,poor,By far the hardest class I've ever taken here at Mason. The exams were hard but many of the questions came from the online homework and quizzes. You will have to study harder and allow more time for this class than any of the other classes your taking.
1418,good,she is amazing!  make sure to get at least one class with her during your time here at UMass.
1560,poor,No Comments
39,poor,"My God, where do I begin&#63;  She grades like it's a level three political science course.  She will tell you what she doesn't want in a paper, then goes back and gives you a bad grade for not including it!  She always carries a 'my way or the highway' attitude.  I've never been that interested in political science, but her teaching style is terrible."
1486,poor,"Please...I beg of you...if you wan to pass Math and simply fulfill the requirement, DO NOT take class with Rudvalis...especially if you're not a Math wiz. Nice guy though and allows you to make up the homeworks as long as you email him an excuse. One sentence tops. I made out with a D luckily, so I fulfilled the R1 but I DO NOT recommend it!"
3012,good,Very good and fair professor and exelent course. I can recomend it for everyone.
169,good,He's a pretty cool professor and you don't have to worry about falling asleep in this class. He does make a few mistakes here and there. There's a lot of homework and two presentations. But he isn't too strict and tries to make learning fun.
1355,good,I came to visit the school last year and sat in on one of her lectures and decided I wanted to make sure I got her for Psych 100 this year.  Amazing and interesting teacher!!!  She makes a class of 500 feel like 10.
2827,good,"I think he has very good intentions although a lot of people may not see it. His course is very helpful if you want to learn about Mathematical Statistics. Most students in the class are from Act. Sci, and so they don't care too much about the theory, which is what he emphasizes a lot."
4179,poor,"Class ok Lectures on-line have to attend LAB with TA. My TA could really care less.  Was there to get tuition reimbursement. Did not explain material well, students corrected her from book, she did not like it, still would not step up to her mistake. Strange class but you can pass if you study. Saw Wolf for 5 minutes, not allowed to email Dr. Wolf"
3101,good,"Nerdy but funny and seems to care about students. Does waste time on useless proofs and doesn't explain then. Overall, he is very fair and will not put anything on the test that he didn't go over in class and was on the h/w. Final is optional."
2682,average,No Comments
3800,good,"I took her for 110 & 111, CLASS IS A JOKE from a Senior student standpoint.  Book is a Piece of****... DONT BUY &quot;NOT HELPFULL&quot;.. CLASS attendance only useful because of the weekly ASSIGNMENTS that are given and to be completed during LECTURE.. IF you took 7th grade environmental science this CLASS IS A JOKE UP&lt;DOWN&lt;LEFT&lt;RIGHT and  CENTER, ur in 4 "
1640,average,"I can see where people are coming from when they negatively rate this professor, but I had no issues with the class. Cook teaches by example and his practice exams are very similar to real exams. The only annoying thing is that he doesn't use technology so don't try e-mailing him.  Overall, acing this class should not be an issue if taken seriously"
1290,good,"She's good! Great class? she makes it interesting and fun by telling all of her old teenage stories haha. It's a pretty easy class, but her exams are harder than students expect.And she gives reading quizzes during lecture, so show up! Take it with her, she rocks."
1380,good,she makes the material really fun and the class is really interactive...one time this kid got up in front of everyone and he basically got naked for an experiement it was HILARIOUS. even though i had the class at 9 MWF it was def worth going
1933,average,"creative, must go to class"
579,good,Awsome!
3340,good,I took her night class once a week and we always got out an hour early. A type personality and she is a fast talker and covers the material very quickly. Asks questions to class by calling out names off the role. tells you exactly what problems she likes and doesn't like. gives good examples and lecture is crucial. I suggest recording her lectures
2030,good,Great class to take for Gen-Ed. Judy is hilarious. Tiny little woman-absolutely adorable! She is well knowledgable in the area (wrote the textbook) and explains everything very clearly. Has everything online and in packets given out here and there. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Definietly take this class if you need a BS gen-ed!
892,good,Good guy.
780,average,"Really nice guy, easy to talk to to, willing to help, but he can't teach. If you have never taken calc then DO NOT take it with him. You will have no idea what he is talking about."
159,poor,I have not learned one thing from this guy all semester. He talks about the most random bs during his lectures that might end up on the test. You can't even self teach because his test question are random and his slides are all paragraphs and pictures. The only good thing about this class are the labs are VERY easy.
2,poor,"""Riiiighhht?"" She is rough. basically don't skip and talk a lot and she will like you, but if you are a person who doesn't like talking in class, you're screwed."
3240,average,Not exactly a bad professor but by no means easy. Go to reccetation! You'll have to put alot of effort into this class if you take her and you may feel that your grade doesn't represent how hard you work but you gotta know you did your best. Very challenging profesor see her during office hours tell her how your doing in the class effort is noted
3904,good,Hands down one of the best professors at Mason. There's a reason she has 15 pages of positive reviews. I never thought someone would make ARTH interesting to me (I'm a science guy and only took it as a requirement). I spoke with her during office hours a couple of times and she's genuinely a nice person. Wish she could teach all of my classes to me
849,poor,"he is a horrible teacher...he knows the information but doesnt clarify it, never organized, always late, the test are WICKED HARD and TRICKY!! i hated that class!!"
3981,good,good proffesor!! Makes art subject interesting even for non-art students. Tests are a piece of cake (comes right off study guides) and 2 simple papers.
2466,good,No Comments
3669,good,"i thnk shes an amazing teacher, explains well and the tests come right out of the powerpoint slides online...tests need studying but if u study hard u'l do great in this class...trust me take her"
1596,good,"Okay, he does a majority of the homework in class, which you later turn in for a grade.  He gives you a practice exam and then goes over it in class.  All of the problems are exactly the same on the test.  Easy class."
1776,good,"One of the most interesting teachers I've met.  He really knows his stuff, no matter what he's talking about.  I think he's a really good teacher."
1913,good,"She's fun and she makes the class fun. Psych is wicked interesting, and you get to watch movies in class. The tests are so easy (as in she basically gives you the answers ahead of time) and there's TONS of extra-credit. Downside: she's too perky in the AM"
1043,average,"Randall is clearly very passionate about biology and he is a great professor. I love how he uses his sense of humor to lighten up the lectures. He also makes time for review sessions where he brings candy! Don't get me wrong this class isn't easy but if you're going to take it, get this Randall."
1544,poor,Terrible teacher. be prepared to teach urself everything and then take impossible tests.
2736,poor,"Utterly horible professor!  Take PSL302 in the summer when he and the other horrible ones aren't teaching it.  Very confusing and boring.  Gets excited about weird things.  One of worst teachers at U of T.  Tough tests, he's not helpful at all!"
2879,good,"Very funny and amazing professor, the grade you get is proportional to the work you put in this course. The material is very straightforward but require you to sit down and read. A lot of kids complain about him, but usually those people don't ever do the readings, or half-ass them."
53,good,"Great intro course for anyone who wants to get into programming, beats codeacademy and other sorts. i'll recommend you check out see . standford . edu for all course material. Amazing.   I cant wait to become so good at programming and finally meet him one day and have the chance to thank him"
1796,good,"Whitbourne gives you a packet of her notes to fill in which is extremely helpful. Most tests consist of her notes and in class videos/presentations. Online assignments are fairly easy just somewhat tedious but overall the class should be an easy A. She is full of energy and enthusiastic which doesn't hurt either. A good class, hardly used book."
1911,good,She's Kick ass....give out a lot of extra credit in case you don't do to well on exams....its the only class i actualli stay awake in even if it is early in the morning
4033,poor,This professor is one mean guy. he gives 0 points for assignments if missed one of the questions. and each assignment is worth 12.5 points out of the course
2553,good,very approachable although notes are disorganized
3167,good,"Very fair teacher, there are two options to calculate your grade. Therefore, if you didn't do a good job on the second exam(the hardest one), you can still make up with final."
3211,good,"This class is not hard at all! Exams are exactly the same as questions in Connect. She just changes the numbers. She wants every student to do well. If you srew up the first exam. She will double count the second grade if it's higher.If you do better on final, it's gonna weigh 60% of total grade. Take her! You really can learn things."
824,good,"for 128, cook does a decent job covering the material considering that it's a hard subject. much better than 127 with Rudvalis. sometimes difficult to see what it is he is talking about, but he will try and clarify if you ask him. I suggest going to the math help center, they take everything he sais in class and makes it easy to understand."
4168,poor,"Annoying to listen to. She has some good examples, but not that great of a teacher overall. She compiled the textbook herself, uses about 5 TA's to teach lectures, but the tests are pretty easy. There were 4 lab assignments (short answer), 3 exams, a recommendation paper (4 pg), a research requirement, and participation (55pt), 1000 total points."
1389,good,No Comments
3879,good,"Excellent professor. Definitely not an easy A, but you won't just go through the motions in this class.  Active thinking required.  She values your input and is fair and reasonable.  Easily one of the top five classes I have taken at Mason."
4221,good,"This is not a hard class... do the paper... it's a pain, but just do it... Wolf is not a bad teacher, just go to class. Tests aren't that hard."
1607,poor,"extremely boring, you only do well bc of the TAs if they even speak english"
1594,poor,He's rude. Waste class time. Says UMMMM too much. Tries to answer questions before the person can finish them. Writes everything WORD FOR WORD. I hate him. 4 hour long tests. Horrible.
771,average,"While hes not the most with it professor, he knows the material well. The course is now streamlined with all the other sections so that the only thing that is different is the professor teaching it. Even if you have to take it with him you can go to any lecture."
2611,poor,"The worst prof I've had at UofT so far.  She barely prepares for her lectures - just flips through a pre-made PowerPoint presentation and glosses over the information with little or no depth.  The problems she goes over in class are rediculously easy compared to her exams.  If I never hear that irritating, nasaly voice again I'd be quite happy."
2273,good,"very clear, articulate. Soc 101 gave me a very different way at looking at macro situational factors, as well as how to analyze them. would definately retake."
1868,good,"She's one of the best teachers I have right now. She uses a lot of examples and visuals during class, so it's easy to pay attention. Her WebCT quizzes are also really straight forward and easy to get a good grade on. She's also really energetic and humerous during lectures, so it's not a complete bore. An all around good class/great teacher! =]"
1085,poor,"In addition, he did not give us a single quiz (which are weekly) or exam (monthly) grades for over a month. Many people did not appreciate being left in the dark about their course grades, including myself."
3223,good,"Study for this class, passing it is not easy. Her final was extremely hard."
1325,good,"She is a very good professor. I'd say do the readings and go to class, take notes using the outlines, and study and it's an easy A if you do. Do the SONA extra credit because it can be worth 6% of your entire grade."
1463,good,"His style's unique-the way he dresses has nothing to do with grades. Yes, he writes every definition down, but that way every things clear. If your confused, ASK QUESTIONS!&#63; he's more than willing to answer them. Students who say he's confusing probably don't show up to class or don't speak up. He's super fair and they're never any surprises."
806,average,Prof. Cook is a very nice man but his class is very difficult. You must go to class to have somewhat of an idea as to what's going on. I was required to take this class for my major and I am absolutely horrible at math. I ended up with a C- probably because I met with him to discuss exams and made it clear that I was trying my best.
3603,good,"Great teacher! STUDY THE STUDY GUIDES SHE GIVES TO YOU FOR EXAMS!!! They are the key, and almost always 90% of it is on the exam. Gives 3 exams and 3 quizzes, allows you to drop the lowest quiz and exam grade. Very lively when lecturing and uses hand motions a lot. If you study the power points and study guides, you'll pass with a high grade."
3401,poor,man oh man... AVIOD TAKING THIS LADY!! TOO BAD YOU HAVE TO TAKE HER.. MUHAHAHAHA
2108,good,Excellent in all respects.
3361,poor,She is not fair on grading and very rude.  You will not want to attend her class.
4359,good,"very nice, understanding teacher. his tests can be hard, but if you read the book, you'll do fine. besides, he gives plenty of extra credit opportunities. come to class and you'll get an A or B."
2234,poor,I'd rather listen for two hours to a telephone pole. That pole could make me learn more material in one class than he could in a dozen. His tests are idiotic and his classes are too (not to mention the prof himself)
963,good,"Schurter is the man! Very Canadian, very funny and very helpful. He is one of the few professors who actually cares about his students as individuals. He makes himself very available and doesn't drench you in work. Must take any class possible with him, best professor in Isenberg, far and away."
398,good,"Molumby is one of the best professors @ UIC!  I think he is one of the smartest, most passionate about his field of work.  His lectures are so prepared with slides that are available online, although his tests are a bit difficult.  Studying and actually GOING TO LECTURE will help greatly.  All the TAs for this class were great too!"
2632,average,"She seems liek a nice person, but tests are pretty hard, not a lot of people knew what to expect."
4269,good,"Professor Wolf is very nice, she makes her lechtures interesting with examples and movie clips. Review sessions for every test. Her tests are kinda hard though, not insane though. It's because her tests are more then definitions, it's applying what you learn to business situations."
704,average,"i really didnt learn much to tell u the truth.  people just talk about thier problems.if ur shy dont take the class,u have to do alot of pub speaking.i had fun though cuz i dont mind takling.dont get me wrong she is suchhh a sweeet lady, nice, kind, always helps u out.awsome person inside nout.but not to informative. mid,fin,jounals,group pres."
431,good,No Comments
292,good,"THE COOLEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!trust me i took this class thinking that it would be boring but this was by far the nicest class, the topic is interesting but his teaching is so much world revolved and it seems like he has large general knowledge, making the class extremely fun. I.E. in lectures his examples used were from pharaohs to Star Wars to roc"
4282,good,"Very kind and sweet guy. Really cares about his students and genuinely wants them to do well. His class is pretty easy, but he makes lectures interesting and fun. Would recommend him a hundred times over."
145,poor,"By far the worst professor I have had.  I had him for BIOS 101 and he made the class extremely difficult and I couldn't tell you a single thing that I learned.  Basically tests you on random lecture fun facts he says periodically and refuses to give answer keys to his previous exams to study for.  If you can, stay as far away as you possibly can!!!"
3856,good,"Amazing professor for art history. Take her if you can! She can relate to her students, and is extremely passionate about teaching the subject material. The tests are not challenging at all because she reviews what is on them before. One project where you go to the art museum in DC. Requires attendance and pop quizzes based off of reading. Easy A!"
2033,good,No Comments
3326,poor,I would rather eat my own vomit than take acct 203 with this teacher again. She scolded the class because half the students got a D or lower on her first 2 exams. She thinks she can do whatever she feels like and is a ridiculously hard test writer.
1165,good,"this guy is the man!  very interested in helping you..holds lots and lots of reviews.  Be ready to learn his diagrams, the book isnt important, just for background knowledge.  Great guy, very smart, and love the red sox."
2050,poor,No Comments
2624,good,No Comments
3614,good,"Dr Fondufe explains things very well and is animated, so you'll stay alert.  I wasn't a huge fan of her tests because she asks a lot of the questions that require you to pick what's not right, or the ones with 5 choices, where E gives you AB/BC/etc.  Study very thoroughly, though, and it should be fine."
339,average,I got an A. It was pretty hard! It all depends on your TA seriously! Dont get Natasha Godard shes retarded grader and has hairy legs yuck! study old exams/review end of chapters and you'll do fine
2857,poor,No Comments
265,good,"extremely nervous prior to his tests because they are very very tricky. He's a great professor and very intelligent guy ;) of course, you do have to study for his exams! that's a given. just hope these next few won't kill me"
2424,good,"Very organized! Very engaging and a great lecturer, even to first year students! Also, extremely helpful outside of class :)"
3677,good,"Great teacher. Explains material very well! She puts her notes up on an overhead - all questions from the exam are from her notes - just go to class to copy the notes, study the notes, and you'll get an A! Do NOT take anyone else!"
1771,poor,"class is almost almost useless, hard to prepare for tests."
271,good,"Real easy B, extremely hard A. As everyone said, exams are just way too tricky."
696,good,"Love her! She is fun, crazy, and down to Earth. She is not always organized but she is laid back. Very helpful if you need help or ur having a problem. The book we had was so bad that she even admitted it! 2"
747,good,Easiest math course @umass. Literally a sad excuse for calc II. MUST GO TO CLASS! All problems done in class are on the test. Tests are NOT based on wileys. If you understand everything he does in class you will get an A. He literally told us which ones were on the test. One of our tests was the practice exam. IMO good at teaching the material.
244,poor,His whole objective is to trick as many students as possible and it sucks. He doesn't use a mic on purpose just to make it harder for students. He reads his rate my professor reviews but never listens to them. I got an A in his class but I would never take him a again because the information he focuses on is wasteful. Good luck! p.s his posture....
317,good,"I will agree with the previous posts, I had him 4 years ago and he does crack a lot of jokes which often got me confused. The exams are brutal and come straight from the text, but nevertheless I felt I learned a lot in this class and all credit to Molumby. Really great guy too."
476,good,"I took 2 classes with him--Biological Anthropology and Cultural Anthropology. He is the best professor I've ever had in my college career. He's extremely smart, and will make ANY topic interesting with his unique perspective on things, and his sense of humor. Tests can be challenging, but if you don't do well, it's on you. He gives reviews ahead"
2032,good,soooooooooo Easy...yea done buy the book. she is so cute! take it!
4026,poor,Worst professor in history. Save the trouble and your money by taking a different teacher in a different semester. Exams are unnecessarily hard. Pop Quizzes. Attendance is mandatory but that's understandable.
2963,average,Does he even do research or just publish intro textbooks&#63;-
813,poor,He teaches the history of math than the math itself. Should reccomend a new book with solved examples of what he teaches in class. He is a a great guy with a good sense of humour. He could improve if he solves more math than talk about it.I suggest he should come to class if he cant speak and stop using sign language.
1914,good,I really enjoyed this course. She is very clear and straightforward with her lectures. Every day was spent watching clips of different films which makes class very entertaining. Tests are very easy as long as you study the material. Definitely recommend.
3998,poor,One thing that professor Lyons forgets is you need your GPA as much as you need the knowledge. He teaches you well but exams are way tougher than lecture. You wouldn't know whether you are passing or failing untill the end if the semester because he doent post grades. You get the knowledge but with bad GPA. The only C you have will be his classes.
1297,good,"EASY A! Attendance isn't necessary, but she does give writing assignments in class that are based on the readings. She gives four exams and drops your lowest score. Readings are interesting, and they're usually followed by an online quiz. Get at least six/ten right and you get a 100% on them! Great teacher. Very interesting. Loved the class!"
1804,good,good professor! Wish I could take her again!
3411,average,"I had her for the combined lec/lab, which is a bad idea for any class, not just this one. She goes very fast and calls on people at random to answer questions in a big lecture, which I hated. She is condescending when you have questions. The class is easy enough I guess. Overall, Hylton is alright."
250,good,One of the easiest class I've taken. His exams are super easy if you attend class and pay attention :)
2461,good,He's hilariouso!
545,good,"Good professor, good class.  She will provide extra help if you if you don't understand something."
738,poor,He rambles about formulas and theories that have nothing to do with the content that's on the test. He does manage to be funny at times but there's nothing funny about not being able to do well in exams and failing the class. He isn't able to deliver concepts well. Unless you're really good at maths don't even bother taking this class.
310,good,"To all the people complaining about his use of anecdotes: Come on, it's a 101 class. Yeah, a lot of people aren't going to need those anecdotes in order to understand the material, but a lot more will appreciate the examples because they aren't used to these concepts. Plus he's really engaging."
1131,good,"If you have to take bio 100, take it with Phillis. He's passionate about what he does, and lectures are entertaining. The material is conceptual, so if you want to get A's you have to attend class, take goods notes, and it is in your best interest to ATTEND THE WEEKLY REVIEWS. Study/Review PRS questions and you'll do fine. Only downfall is the LAB!"
1449,poor,This guy is poor. You don't have to go to class because the stuff he teaches in class are not on the tests. You have to teach yourself everything. Go to the TA sessions because no one can understand this man. poor teacher
4327,average,"Basically, you don't really need to show up for his class, just read the book. Quizzes are mainly definitions of terms and tests are applications of the terms. He kind of just rambles on, and often isn't clear."
15,average,"People that don't like her don't try.  If you come to class prepared and no somewhat about whats going on in the world you'll get an A.  Her tests are somewhat difficult, but overall fair.  The papers are easy if you have her proofread them."
2769,poor,No Comments
920,good,She CARES. If she feels like we're not understanding she starts the lecture overrewords to ensure u understand.  You can tell she's passionate abt her field and teaching. 3 tests & 1 assignment. Tests are short answer & MC. gives EC . I loved going to class. I learned more in her lectures than I did an entire semester w other professors. TAKE HER
3318,poor,"Prof. Hylton was definitely unfriendly and was not helpful. She flies through the material and doesn't really try to help you out if you ask her a question. Try to avoid taking her class if possible. If you do take her class, just go to recitation and don't bother with the lecture, you won't learn anything from her anyway."
2544,good,"looks like the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz, very clear and good lecturer"
3802,good,typical lecture class really hard to drag myself out of bed at 930 e very morning. pay attention to the study guides and i'd recommend coming to classs because she doesnt post notes online pretty boring but work hard and youll get through it
363,good,"this teacher is the best!! one of the best science teachers tha t i know of.. knows his material very well.. his exams are tough,  u need to read the book very carefully, like every line..haha..overall, he is good"
182,average,"Too much info for a 100-level class. A lot of the points come from the TA, probably like 35-40%. Use outside resources to prepare for the exams."
1194,good,"Great Professor! This has been my favorite class this semester. Most of the information is explained very clearly (as clearly as it can be at least). He's got great energy, so the lessons are always fun to look forward too."
2852,good,No Comments
3809,poor,"THIS CLASS SUCKS! SHE SPEEDS THROUGH HER NOTES TOO FAST. SHE DOESN'T POST THEM ONLINE, SO IF YOU MISS CLASS U R SCREWED. SHE MAKES YOU BUY A $100 BOOK AND YOU NEVER EVER USE IT!!!! ALL MATERIAL ON TESTS ARE FROM HER NOTES! HER STUDY GUIDES ARE A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. I GOT B'S IN HER CLASS...BUT IT WAS A ****, AND SHE NEVER RESPONDS TO HER EMAILS!!!"
1121,poor,he might be a great professor if u just want to get a good grade but he sucks when it comes to teaching
2235,poor,He is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad! We're talking about bad cubed. He is totally boring and will put you to sleep in a matter of milliseconds. He so egotistical too. Get a clue Sherlock-you're not!
2667,poor,No Comments
1182,good,"He makes the class fun and interesting, but the tests are a whole different story.  The tests are not very clear- Multiple choices and all the choices are the correct answers but you have to find the best correct answer."
3458,good,"Good teacher, pretty funny, seems scary at first, but shes cool. If you do all the homework you'll do fine."
614,good,"Yes, gives 4-5 essays, but he outlines exactly what he expects when grading. He asks you send in rough drafts and then edits them for you to improve your grade! He's very specific and you can tell he cares deeply for literature. His pop quizzes do make reading the required assignments essential, but overall this course was a breeze. "
1466,poor,this guy is poor. everyone has said it! do not take this class. if you want an r1 take another elective! rudvalis is so confusing. he explains everything in words. he is the most confusing math teacher i have ever come across. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
401,good,"i took his class last semester, and he is FUNNY!!! but i earned a C! dang! one of my test Fuked me up!"
934,good,"Professor Christopher is the best professor in the CRIM department, because of her I now have changed my major to SOCI and my minor to CRIM. She grades fairly. Midterm and final are eassy. No attendance policy but it is helpful for the essay style questions because she hates minimalist."
2419,good,"one of the best prof. i have ever seen of U of T. His teaching style is unique and the most amazing thing that i found is that, what ever he teaches goes directly in to the mind right away."
3135,poor,Reading the book is more helpful
2641,poor,"She sucks. Her tests are ridiculous. I swear, the questions she puts are on the level of intermediate accounting. I took this course as an elective, but I don't recommend anyone to take it unless you have to."
3111,average,Interesting hand gestures and general movement. Writes really really fast. No joke.
726,average,No Comments
826,poor,"Prof. Cook has good intentions but doesn't know how to teach his material. He is often late and unprepared, and can't answer questions clearly when asked. You practically have to teach yourself how to do all the work in the class, the lectures are no help."
1521,poor,He's just plain bad. Writes everything he says word by word on a project.  I'M SERIOUS!!! Speaks like the clear eye guy and makes you want to wonder why   life is so rough.  I went to his classes three times and then I looked up Calden's sections on spire and starting attending hers. She's much MUCH MUCH better.
4177,poor,I'm sure she writes her own reviews. She changes the ppts provided by McGraw's website as her own and just basically reads off of em. The material is common sense but she tries to make it hard and tricks people to keep class grades at a 71% avg to make the class seem legit. Case paper rubric is diff from one used to grade your paper.
136,good,Nice guy. Loves his profession and his mercedes. Would do anything to help his students succeed.
628,good,"I have never left a review for a professor before, but felt compelled to as I greatly enjoyed Prof Everett's British Literature course. I'm a full-time Baylor student and took his course online to save money. I can honestly say I feel like I have learned more than any English/Lit course I've taken at Baylor. Would highly recommend to anyone."
334,good,"Molumby, I know you're reading this...your exams suck! They're too hard :( But the review session and study guide was extremely useful!"
390,good,Dr. Molumby was the lone highlight of my stint here at UIC. I have a hand problem so I cannot do scantrons the professor personally hand graded my exams. He is very laidback and is a extremely exceptional professor. I got a C in the course but this class has made me love biology
3624,good,"read textbook, use ppt slides and jot down notes in class. easy A for you. some questions come from cd and study guide. she is excellent professor."
1817,poor,Urg
400,good,"Molumby's class was one of the best I've taken at UIC.  He has a good sense of humor, and makes the subject matter interesting.  It is pretty obvious he enjoys his work, so don't be a ****bag to him. If you go to lecture, and do the work, the class is definitely possible.  He is quite cute, as a few people have mentioned, and it is a pity he's married (for us, not him), but that has nothing to do with him as a UIC professor. I hope he stays for a while longer, he is a definite asset to the school. :)"
710,good,"everone overrates her cos she is a sweet talker. not a good teacher.does not use exact terms from the book and makes the course look easy.there is no real learning in gossiping.if u r interested in learning 'interpersonal relationship' , stay away from this enchantra!I got A but don't recommend her"
1039,good,GO TO CLASS. I'm telling you now you will get behind after missing one class. He uses the iClicker for participation too. Every Friday he gives a quiz so you better not plan on going home on Thursday. He does drop your three lowest quiz grades though and averages the test grades out to be best for you. I really do like him as a professor.
3091,good,"Good teacher, cares a lot about whether students are learning and has a nice sense of humor.  Gives hard tests, but assignments are brief and painless."
4093,poor,His Philosophy: American's are dum dum and he is genius from North Chakalakeeeee (i guess that's in Australia).
1561,poor,"if u have any sort of problem, this man does not help. he will in fact create more problems. do not recommend this man"
4222,good,"Super professor! Loved the class. One of the few classes where I have really learnt something. Very fair grader, very objective so you know if you work hard, you will do well. Take her MBA 713 class and you will be glad you did!"
3973,good,"Easily the best prof. I've had at Mason. Extremely enthusiastic and interesting, her class is so easy that if you don't get an A/B+ there's something wrong with you. She makes it painfully clear what's on the exams."
1112,poor,"This teacher was absolutly horrible. He would dance around the answers to questions having everyone saying, after a 30 minute lecture on one question, &quot;what is the answer&#63;&quot; do not take his class if your new to umass, its very hard to understand and take notes based on what he says."
2513,good,"He is very organized, but maybe it's just me, but he's not as good as Winnik in making the boring material more interesting!  Perhaps more beer talks will help keep me awake!"
1223,average,works backwards from most bio 100 courses
3940,good,"The architecture class was a lot of fun, no need for book.  Great teacher, attendance mandatory.  Study hard and you will do well.  Misspelling is deducted so know the words and know the buildings.  Great great class."
2421,good,he teaches really good but his tests are really hard.
1508,poor,No Comments
1750,good,Great guy all around.  Tests are very hard- mainly tricky.
3173,poor,"Please don't take this professor unless your trying to learn the material on your own. Do not expect any sort of help from her, I don't know how GMU takes money from their students but fail to have at least a second accounting professor. You might as well give away your money instead of paying for this class"
1799,average,"She has good intentions and really loves to teach psych. She is really into the material.There are a lot of extra credit points given out, which is nice. She isn't helpful when you ask for help. She has her TA's do all the work. Her tests are really hard! I would try to take it with another teacher if possible!"
338,poor,"this class is not hard. the exams are ok. i got a b in the class. but if i studied harder i would have been able to get an A. its not impossible to get an A, just study a lot and i didnt do that. molumbys ok, he tries to be funny in class but hes not. murrays exams are a lot easier than molumby. molumby tries to trick you. overall not a hard clas"
215,average,"Really cool guy. Really passionate about what he does, which is always nice. Getting an A in his class is not easy though. 60% of the class grade is based on 3 exams, which themselves are pretty challenging. The highest grade I received was an 85%, so I had to be almost flawless in every other area. I got the A by, literally, 4 points."
1341,good,She is great!
3963,good,"One of the best class, but you must come to class. But no sweat, because you WANT to come to class and look forward to it every day."
1520,poor,"He is a horrible professor.  No joke here!  I've yet to rate a professor, but I jus thought I should help others out, seeing that I was so oblivious and ended up taking this guy's class.  He even decided to make the second exam way difficult because hes a **** and felt that the exam grades for the first exam were too high."
3053,good,"Way too many assignments: 3 10pg lab reports, 4 20min orals, 2 midterms, 2 5pg lab tour reports.  One or two assignments due per week - made it hard to keep up in other classes.  On the plus side, he is a better teacher than our other chem profs, and the grading wasn't impossible: the curve was: 1 A+, 7 A's, 1 A-, 7 B's, 1 C, 1 F."
2932,average,"absolutely horrible. if he likes you, you are set. if he doesnt, then youre done. so suck up from day one. class material is interesting and lecture style is fun. but he ll kill you on teh participation marks. worst prof experience ive ever had."
2864,poor,You will learn absolutely nothing and be bored out of your mind in this course
3185,good,"Hylton isn't as bad as everyone says she is. She can be a little too blunt at times, but that's because she wants everyone to learn. Her tests are an exact replica of the homework and connect quizzes, just different numbers (she even says this). Concepts aren't hard to understand, you just have to do them over and over again. "
2322,good,"He's a great teacher, his lectures are really interesting but his tests are hard"
2571,good,"One of the most inspirational professors in Rotman. Super friendly if you get to know her. Actually cares about your experience in the program, apart from just the academics. Doesn't care about grades as much as she cares about learning. Elisa is the heart and soul of the accounting program at Rotman. She will be there for you."
2913,poor,"Talks only about one point of view, the two books used for the course, he wrote."
101,good,he is good we all need such profs
3381,good,I really liked her. She knows her material. She is very nice outside of class but you just have to let her get to know you. I recommend her for any ACCT class. : ) Very helpful.
171,poor,"poor professor. He doesn't teach, refuses to use the mic during lecture so it's hard to hear him even if you're sitting in the front. His lecture ppts were impossibly long and you need to memorize every single word basically since he asks about weird details in his exams. Posted practice exams w/out answers on BB which were useless. Avoid him."
107,good,This guy is unbelievably good!
3316,poor,"I took Hylton last semester and dropped after the first few weeks...I'm glad I did! Contrary to the other poster, it doesn't have anything to do with your skin color she is just an unfair grader and a poor teacher. 1 mistake out of the entire assignment and she will give you a 2/10. Bravery will not be rewarded, take someone else!!!"
4391,average,"if ur enrolled, DROP before its too late!!  take O'Toole.. i dropped after the first lecture. my counselor told me he is the WORST soc professor on campus!!"
3460,good,"Dr. Fondufe is a very animate lecturer, and seems passionate about biology. Going to class and paying attention is crucial if you don't want to study so hard. She doesn't take attendance so I chose to not go to class ever. I had to self teach myself, so thats why I rate this class at a 4 difficulty, but that is the only reason why."
3642,average,"High pitched voice and very animated, but she does get the point across.  She talks the WHOLE lecture.  Very little interaction with her or classmates.  Exams are pretty easy if you do the study guide."
2996,good,"excellent prof, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. tests are hard and very much memorization based."
3206,poor,"The worst teacher at Mason. I retook this class with another teacher and got an A. She flies through PowerPoints and doesn't make sure everyone is following along. Speaks extremely fast and will not slow down. The class is supposed to be an hour and 15, but ends up being 40-45 minutes because she talks so fast."
4211,good,"she is really really sweet! and class is fun, great prof"
3537,good,"Class had clicked questions. 4 exams and a final. Study straight from the powerpoint and nothing more, I got an A in the class. All the information you really need to know come from the powerpoints, if you don't put in work you won't get the grade you want. simple as that."
3671,good,"Her lectures are very structured and detailed.  Study guides outline just what will be on the exam.  Exams are hard as hell but if you put the time in, you should have no problem getting an A.  Also, she's very understanding, which helps."
4064,good,"Prof. Lyons is a SUPERB professor. Tough YES, but an inconsiderate grade butcher NO. If you study the course material, especially his lecture notes that he posts on Bb, and give the course syllabus a good read to be aware of his expectations, you will do fine. HWs (fun and not that hard) at 40% of total course grade was a free grade giveaway IMHO."
1040,good,"I liked this professor. He knows a lot about genetics in which I am interested. He sometimes throws some random information at you. Cyclin D, Angiotensin etc. I love those random stuff. some don't. I highly recommend it. His exams are tricky tho."
3299,poor,"Probably the biggest **** at mason. Very rude towards students. Yells too much during class and FINAL EXAM, making it annoying to concentrate. Absolutely useless, take any professor but this ****"
2760,poor,he hates undergrads with a passion (I've seen him make undergrads cry)
2120,poor,"Terrible professor. Sometimes seems to struggle with basic statistics. Points often fail to stand up to basic scrutiny. He also has an exceptionally slimy way of milking textbook money from students, even for a prof."
1524,good,"first off i dont have strong opinions on any teachers but i thought i'd share to help future students: horrible teacher writes words on the board, 2 tests&final i went first semester then i realized how bad he was and went to calden and she was amazing, no excuses for doing bad in 127 just go to another class they dont take attendance no excuses."
4039,poor,"I will say this. When a man is trying to win the award for world's bigger b-hole, he'll usually find a way to get it done. Few people can hold a candle to this man in such a contest."
2248,good,He lectures in a clear and concise manner which makes it easy to follow and understand.Really enjoy the course.Can follow a lot from experience probably because I'm older than the majority.AND I don't think he's bad looking contrary to one comment on here
481,good,I took Dr. Capelotti for Anth 045 and Anth 021 and ended up changing my major to biological anthropology because of his positive influence.  He is hilarious and is very easy to talk to.  Definitely going to miss him when I go up to PSU University Park.
3357,good,"This professor is the most condicinding professor I have ever taken.  She treats everyone like children and puts herself on a peddle.  Took this course during the summer, of which the information came fast, but when exam time came for the final information on it wasn't taught in class.  Only reference to it was in homework."
3484,good,"Fondufe is a passionate teacher that loves what she is doing and shows she really cares for biology by the way she expresses the content during her lectures. I also had her for lab and she was always very helpful and would happily assists you. Honestly, towards the end I did not show up to class much but just read the lecture slides and you're okay"
1762,poor,going to class is useless! he doesn't teach
3914,good,This is my 3rd class with her and I plan to take a 4th next semester hopefully.  She's that good and gets you interested in the material.  The text is a bit dry but she helps clarify it in class. This is the class that you work your butt off for a B and end up proud of it. She's very blunt and always energetic.
4010,poor,"he is extremely rude, i do not understand why he is still teacher. He always talks down to students, clearly we are here to learn don't make us feel bad for asking a legit question that seems ""stupid"" to him. DON'T TAKE HIM! I had to teach myself to get a C "
3268,poor,"She may be somewhat comprehendible for acct 203, but not for upper level accounting courses. Avoid at all cost. I am graduating a semester late just to avoid her. It says something when every acct 361 class has at least 10 people on the wait list and hers is not even close to being full."
3225,poor,"Professor Hylton is just not a nice lady. She only was friendly the day of her teacher evaluations. Furthermore, all the people who say ""if you study you do fine"" are lying. The journal entries she gives are not the ones in the book. Im a relatively smart economics major and I will be glad if I get a B.  She says to ""study hours upon hours."""
405,good,AN amazing teacher who loves what he does.
757,poor,DO NOT take calculus 128 with this professor. I've never been so confused about math in my life and he does not care to help students understand the material he is teaching. Cook is a really sweet and funny old man but certainly doesn't know how to teach. Material on hw and exams are completely different from what he teaches. Avoid his class!!!
2711,poor,No Comments
2670,good,No Comments
3271,average,"Her class is very passable and although she is strict, she is not as bad as everyone makes her out to be. She just expects the acct grads to have better business etiquette and higher CPA passing rating then we do.  Beware she is one of the hardest graders and takes more points off then other teachers. She also grades harder if u miss class or tardy"
97,good,his is a genious
1333,good,"Lectures are interesting, homework and quizzes are a piece of cake, exams are average. Go to lecture and do the readings and this class is an easy A."
3756,good,"Excellent teacher.  Lectures are interesting.  Tests follow the lecture and powerpoint.  If you do the learning guide and go to lecture. You will most likely get an A.  Including lab, there are a lot of small assignments which take 4-8 hrs /wk.  Don't buy the book."
2791,poor,WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD!!! DID NOT LEARN ANYTHING!!! AVOID HIM AT ALL COST!!!
2854,average,marking scheme is quite advantageous. memorize for a good grade.
186,good,"Hilarious lectures that keep you engaged for the full 50 minutes. Attend lectures and review these before exams, that's essentially all you need to study. Everyone says the exams are tricky, but they aren't if you know the material.... Labs and discussion are for the most part busy work which is annoying. 2 group presentations."
3684,good,"Excellent biology teacher! Her exams are easy and if you pay attention, you'll pass."
3725,good,Great professor. She likes to tell personal stories during some of her lectures and it keeps things interesting; it even helped me remember the material better. She makes jokes sometimes during lecture which is good too. Tests are pretty easy and there is plenty of opportunity for extra credit. I would take her class again.
2058,good,"She was a great professor- handed out packets of notes to study from so you could pay full attention during class. Interesting, funny, and clear. Made sure everyone understood the material before moving on. Tests came straight out of the notes"
3321,good,"Real easy class, simple stuff, easy homeworks, lots of reading but with any class there will always be reading. I got A+ and 95's on all exams, she is sort of rude but thats her personality cant change her. Advice: Just read the book and don't attend her lectures."
148,average,"Molumby was harsh this semester. He's a great speaker, but gets off topic very easily. You have to memorize EVERY SINGLE DETAIL on his PPs as he bases his exams off of that solely and loves to put in the worthless content (like what species has what scientific name). Exams are tough but are common sense mostly. Study up for exams & you'll be ok."
28,good,"She's a great professor!  I personally never had any problems with her and loved her class.  Her class made me love political science, government, and history even more than I did before taking the class.  She was very helpful in writing papers and was nice overall.  Her lectures were also very interesting and fun.  I highly recommend this class!"
3227,good,"In order to do well in this class you must study. There is no other way. People who complained about the class probably did so because they just want an easy A. Professor Hylton teaches fast, but she wants to see everybody pass. She gives curves and tells you what to study. If you fail this class it's on you for not studying."
3105,good,"By far one of the BEST professors I had this semester. He'll chase students, wake them up in front of the whole class....it was overall good."
692,good,"I love her! OMG, what a great person. She makes a terrible class not so bad! In fact, I will miss this class. I am so glad I took her class."
2866,poor,No Comments
1386,good,"The class has really boring material, so if you don't have to take it, don't. If you do have to take it, DEF take it with prof. Rahhal.  She's soo cute and tons of fun!"
1845,good,Extremely easy class. She really wants you to do well in class. You can fail all exams and still get a B in the class. VERY energetic teacher even in the morning.
3232,good,"I got a low F on my first exam. She told me not to drop and that if I worked harder I'd do fine. I ended up getting a 77, 83, and 81 on the final and got a B. She looks out for her students if you go to her for help. If you don't try you won't do well, but she is a good teacher and I am taking 301 with her in the Fall"
1599,poor,uhhhhhh...hes so uuuuuuterly boring...remember those FRACtions.
3536,good,"No need to buy the book, her slides are on point for what you need for your exam. Her study guides are very helpful. She does give iclicker quizzes for attendance. Great teacher, one of my favorites."
701,poor,No Comments
2969,average,"I had this guy back in 1997.  He was pretty funny! All he kept saying was ""undestandzz dis, once and for all!"" lol"
1708,poor,"Do all the OWLS, get at least 7 out of 14 questions right on each of the tests, and you'll get a C. If you do worse you will fail. He makes that very clear. Go to the reviews before each test, they help a lot."
2953,good,"Listens well, open-minded. I had a problem with some of the things he said about other periods of history since he got the facts wrong."
454,good,"really funny, cool and helpful. tough class tho"
2868,average,"Tests were straight from the textbok, so memorize the textbook legit. If you can't go to lecture don't sweat it, letures are repeated from the text so you'll be able to answer the lecture questions on the tests. Easy bird course."
2040,good,not a hard class for nonscience majors. do the readings and attend a class or 2 and you'll do fine.
3303,poor,"She talks too fast, her voice is extremely annoying to be honest, sometimes addresses the class as if they're in kindergarten, and her tests are pretty hard. Either study or drop the class. The TA kinda sucks, as well. Annoying, not all that helpful... Bad teachers, relatively tough class. Take from another lecture teacher if you can. GL."
2315,good,"Loved this class. Great teacher, one of my favs. Made me go into Sociology."
609,good,"Mr. Everett is very passionate and really wants the student to perform to their potential. He likes the use of Powerpoint slideshows and he lectures for long periods of time. There are four main essays in which he is a stickler for grammar but as long as you follow directions you'll be fine. Reading will help. Ask questions, he is ready to help."
167,average,"He does iclicker so you have to show up. He doesn't teach anything in class. One second he's talking about bird, go on your phone, look up again, & he'll be talking about the new Star Wars movie. I had an 89 in the class & the TA didn't round me up. Your grade truly depends on the TA. Material wise, it's a very easy class, it's like high school bio"
730,good,"Would not reccomend taking the 75 minute lecture block, just too much drole for uninterested people. That said, he does clearly explain math concepts. Just be a good student and actually read the book, learn the theorems and rules, and you will do well. Makes corny math jokes to diffuse a bored atmosphere but he teaches well otherwise."
3395,good,"You have to work to get the grade you want in this class. But Hylton tries to really help the students understand the material. She certainly does expect you to have studied and done the homework (hello, it IS college). She's enthusiastic in her lectures and very available with lots of office hours."

1622,good,"Professor Cook is a great teacher. His lectures are clear and I learnt a lot from it. He always made jokes and it is a great fun to go to class. Of course, studying math always takes effort and sometimes tedious, but his class inspired me to learn more and keep going. "

1401,good,I LOVED this class. This is the only class I actually looked forward to. Tammy is great. She makes the class a lot of fun. It's an easy A and she gives a lot of extra credit. I hope that I take one of her classes again.
1700,good,"THE CLASS IS SO EASY THAT IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT, YOU WILL FAIL. COOK IS A NICE GUY AND HE GOES OVER EXAMPLES A LOT. GO TO CLASS, DO THE OWLS AND MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE OLD EXAMS HE HANDS OUT. YOU DO JUST FINE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T PROCRASTINATE."
3778,good,"Great professor. She tries her best to make her lectures interesting, but can be dry sometimes. This is the perfect class for anyone seeking to fulfill his/her science gen. ed. since the class is slow-paced and very approachable. Highly recommended. Also, DON'T BUY THE BOOK, only the lab manual."
2981,average,He taught a seminar (Virology). He made students feel embarrassed and awkward during presentations.
3716,good,"She was a good professor. She was very helpful. I learned a lot from her. In addition to office hours, she was willing to offer time outside of class to help students understand the material. But she does have a tendency to go off topic during lectures and give less than desirable information about herself. Labs and tests are tough."
1379,good,"very fun class, interactive and interesting. GREAT professor."
2089,good,I love this Professor's class! He is the best ever. Really easy and he explains everything until you understand. He understands when you have emergencies and he gives extra credit. His class will be the only class you will really learn while having an easy A. I Strongly recommend him for everyone!!!!
2175,good,"Great professor.  Confident, clear.  Wrote the textbook, which is fantastic.  Covered great depth and breadth of material.  Responded to and encouraged student feedback on his performance.  Good use of powerpoint slides.  Very fair testing!"
3527,good,"She is a very nice woman, but the class can get very boring. She talks A LOT especially if you have her for the lab portion of the class. The final exam was very long and contained a lot of information. If you study a lot, you will probably do well."
3819,good,"Ok, this is the easiest science class I've ever taken. All you have to do is make good use of the study guide, and you'll ace the tests. The lecture notes are online so you don't have to go to class. Just make sure you show up on test days!"
3032,good,amazing!!!
2657,poor,"She seems to be bored to death on her own lectures, and doesn't really into the subject. It makes students fall asleep or get very annoyed after 5 minutes. The tests are hard compared to the quality of the lectures."
3831,good,read from the book
441,good,"He is a great dance teacher. He helped me to get better, and want to learn more about the dance world."
3138,poor,apparently this is his first year teaching this class although he still blows.  im lucky i know calc and i just bombed the placement test because hes the worst prof ever.
2051,average,"this teacher was supposed to be really easy, however, this year she feels like people took her for granted last year so shes really hard and not very nice, she wants to try and trick you on the exams."
2541,good,This prof ROCKS!
1301,good,"Amazing professor! Engaging and inspiring-not a difficult class, but good to do readings and you might as well go to class, her lectures are always interesting. Gives you many opportunities to succeed."
4008,good,"I know he's not much liked, but he acts totally different when teaching Network Defense. The class is easy, with most of the grade really being attendance, and he's kinda nice. He won't even yell about the water bottles when teaching this."
1304,good,"Tammy is an good professor who knows how to keep her audience engaged and interested (even with 500 people) I didn't open my textbook once and still got an A in the class, and I also skipped a bunch of times. Do the assigned readings and you can basically predict when there will be quizzes. Easiest and best class i had last semester"
236,good,"Not boring, extremely cool. Not a hard grader."
2599,poor,Sooo many typos in new tests/past tests/posted answers.  I am so confused.  Even makes mistakes during class.
520,good,"Hysterically funny, even though a lot of people (namely freshmen) didn't get his humor. Loved the social commentary."
2573,poor,"Don't bother go to her class, everything she says is in the textbook. Took it in the summer. She's not at all helpful and super lazy. However tests are pretty easy... until the final. But if you study for it you will be fine."
2768,poor,No Comments
735,poor,Cook is an poor professor. He's super nice but very old and thus rambles during lectures and is never very clear with concepts. You really need to teach yourself the material in order to pass because his lectures are all over the place. Try to take it with anyone else if you can. No book use whatsoever except to teach yourself the entire course.
4141,poor,"Very rude professor I ever seen in my life.  Always hard grader on papers, exams, and homework.No point to ask any questions because he makes u feel dumb as sh*it.I recommend ?NOT? to take this guy.Always trying to catch people for honor code (I think he loves doing that)."
2106,average,"He tended to teach the heavier topics, but honestly I found him a good professor. You realize how passionate he is in sociology when you get to talk to him. You should go to lectures, he discusses different things in them. It's memorization for the most part, read the textbook and go to lecture and you'll be fine!"
2679,good,"Funny, kept my attention in class, could have used more detial in lectures."
2761,poor,No Comments
592,poor,"He is the worst teacher ever.  He does not explain clearly  his grading criteria but picking  ridiculously  on some detail that unnecessary.  Though this is online class, he forces student to attend on his certain time.  When student has issue, it takes him forever to response.  I seriously warn you if u decide to take him.  Horrible nightmare !"
1303,good,"One of the best professors at UMass! Take psych 100 with her, she does an amazing job at grabbing students attention. Don't buy the book, you really do not need it, not only an easy A but great class!"
1387,good,my fav
4133,good,"Professor Lyons comes off as being a hard ass, but he's a much better teacher than people give him credit for, IMO.  Plus he's only an ass to students who don't pay attention or skip class (not too surprising I guess).  He knows his stuff and he explains himself quite well.  Do the HW, study exams, and don't BS the paper."
3063,poor,Horribly run course.
3975,good,"I'm a senior and only took this class to fulfill of my fine arts req.. My major is political science/internaional governance, so my interest initially was not very high. However, even though this was just a 100 level class, this teacher managed to make it interesting. I appreciated her high expectations which made me wish for more teachers like her"
2987,good,He made sure that his notes were available in the library for free so we didn't have to buy a textbook.
4330,poor,Extremely boring. Just read the text book and stay home. :)
904,good,"Best professor ever! She's very precise and clear on her expectations. She comes through on her part and she expects you to do the same as well. I love the fact that she relates her life to her students because she has once been where we are and she keeps it real. She does her job and go, no extras! You rock Kelley!"
4013,poor,"If you are in security, you can't avoid taking a class with him, but be warned he is rude to students and a terrible teacher. For the final, most of the class didn't know what to study because it felt like we had learned nothing all semester. Tests were based on random things he said in class and useless concepts. VERY unorganized about homework. "
1279,good,"Great teacher- keeps the lessons interesting, hilarious, and relates well to students- social type."
3774,good,"Class was extremely easy but was uninspiring and boring. Most of the people were just there to get their science credit, and Prf Largen didn't do much to alleviate that with her repetitive powerpoint slides. Labs were an absolute nightmare...almost an insult to our intelligence. All busy work, no real college level work."
4311,average,"I took this class for Summer 2013 and he's a really nice professor. However, he just talks and doesn't use any visuals. If you are a visual person, don't take. You can really pass this class if you read the textbook, other than that, you are going to have to sit and listen to him. Personally, I would not take him again."
2308,good,YEAH
3754,good,So um... let me start off by saying the class is fairly easy I guess.. However THE LAB IS HELL!!!! The work load is ridiculous.  The lab is also like 3 1/2 hours long.  But she does give alot of extra credit.
3876,good,AMAZING PROFESSOR! She's so nice and funny and makes learning about art history very interesting. Three exams overall but straight off the study guide. One short paper due in the middle of the semester. Very straightforward and fun class.
3740,good,"OK! i got a 100 on a exam with taking any not and listening in class. It is a easy A as long as you do the study guides for each powerpoint and understand the concept. However, the I clicker is annoying since It is random and her class is somewhat tedious. Also, Lot of small homeworks to do(kinda like HS class) especially in lab."
706,good,"She is such a nice lady. The course really is not that hard. You have journals to do for each chapter, two test, and a group presentation but when you're in the class all you do is talk. I did not mind going to this class. Great professor to take for this class."
4128,poor,"Prof. Lyons is quite possibly the biggest, self-centered **** I have ever met. If you need help or clarification on an assignment, be aware that Prof. Lyons will respond with one - two sentence answers that DO NOT address the original question. If at all possible try to take this course with another professor."
745,good,Prof Cook is an excellent man. He is funny and really knows his stuff. He can explain any problem to you. He is enthusiastic about his teaching and wants you to understand. He is always in the lab if you need help. Would take him again as a professor.
1939,good,You really do not need to go to this class at all if you buy the notes. She reads directly off the slides. Homework is only worth 10% of your grade and they are quick online assignments. They are also pyramid tests so what you do in class counts as 75% of your grades and what you do at home counts as 25%. TAKE THIS CLASS ITS SO EASY & INTERESTING.
3656,good,"The subject is hard, not the teacher.  She explains as much as you want.  Her quizzes are not hard if you listen to her lectures."
2862,good,clear and a really easy course
3095,good,I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I'm not aware of 21-259 but this guy's 21-256 class is TOO easy. The proofs are not difficult to understand and he provides plenty of examples. Sometimes people ask really stupid questions about how he does certain things which leads me to think they are too slow. Recitation is useless for me.
513,good,"great teacher. relates topics in class to current events, really funny and nice. study the ANGEL notes for the exam and you'll be fine. =D"
81,good,"He makes learning a joyful , fun experience!! I wish even my college had teachers like him."
4378,poor,"While this teacher is nice his lectures make absolutely no sense. Even if you do all the readings and attempt to take notes on his lectures you will not pass his exams, which sometimes do not make sense either."
1308,good,"I loved this class and this professor.  She made the class really interesting and easy to understand.  I highly recommend her, it was my favorite class this semester."
4196,good,"she is the only one who teaches mgmt 301, so u have no choice. she is great, very helpful down to earth very clear, keeps u focus, uses real life examples, not hard at all, gives u plenty of time to do the work, she is great over all, I would love to take her again for another course, she is great."
914,good,"Love her so much. Relatable and funny, tells how it is not what society says. Tests are easy (she gives you the answers). She takes 10 points off your final grade if you come in late, but no attendance policy. Really passionate and all around good. Take her and you will not regret it, if you make a B you just need to drop out of college."
4227,poor,"save yourself and escape while you can.  this teacher has real attitude problem.  she knows how to teach management, but can't follow her own lectures and apply them to hersef."
2198,good,"excellent prof, but I hated the course."
774,poor,"Means well, but lecture does not follow the book.  He teaches Math 128 as if it was Math 132.  You can read and understand the book and walk out of lecture scratching you head.  Avoid if at all possible."
329,good,"This class was great, mainly due to Molumby being an amazing prof.  His enthusiasm and personal examples made this class interesting.  I seriously considered switching to a bio major after this course.  There are lots of assignments and the exams are tricky so you have to work for that A.  Overall, good prof and he has great taste in music."
2054,good,Great professor and a very nice person. Very helpful and interesting. The class isn't very hard.
2001,good,"judy g is amazing. her class is fair, interesting, and the material is stuff that is actually relevant to life. all the notes are online, there is tons of extra credit and the lectures are really interersting. get the full outline because all of the classes follow it to a t. loved the class, it made me want to major in something science related"
943,good,HANDS DOWN THE BEST PROFESSOR AT UWG! SHE IS FUNNY AND VERY ENGAGING. SHE MADE ME SO INTERESTED IN SOCIOLOGY THAT I HAD A WHOLE NEW OUTLOOK ON IT AND CHANGED MY MAJOR TO IT. SHE IS THAT GREAT! LOVE HER. SHE IS A MUST TAKE!
822,good,"While most people in this class dont enjoy the subject, he does a good job explaining an otherwise boring subject. You need to go to class, but as long as you do, you will do well on the exams."
3886,good,She is a true inspiration. I am an accounting major but she made art history so interesting that I ended up taking architecture with her too. Not an easy class but I learned a lot from her.
909,good,"This is the second time I have had her as a professor, she is amazing and she knows it. I love her class and I love her. She basically hands you the exam and gives plenty of time to study. Her stories are hilarious and she is there for you when you need her. She will email you at 1:00 am lol, she helped me through a lot personally and school wise."
2516,good,"sometimes hard to pay attention, b/c he's so cute"
181,good,"Molumby is an good and smart professor! Lectures were amazing. Any sound issues were the result of people rudely speaking during lecture. Tests are slightly confusing and require you actually know the material, not just memorize old answers. Group presentations were horrible considering my group didn't do anything at all."
164,poor,"I don't know why he has good reviews, but this is prob the worst professor at UIC.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1523,poor,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.  I went to 95% of the classes and got a terrible grade.  OWLs are hard.  None of his lectures help with the homework.  You completely rely on the book.  Tests are extremely difficult.
451,poor,Worst professor ever! If you care about your grade don't take him. Exams are super hard!!!
2538,good,marry me scottie!!!
3186,poor,"I had no choice but to take her for this course. Her quizzes, homework, and lecture are different difficulties. The first 3 exams were easy/medium level if you study, but the final was so hard. But she will try to help you out by making the final worth 60% if you have a higher average on the 3 exams. She is rude to students when it comes to class."
1311,good,"Great teacher, great class.....actually thats an understatement. Take this class!!!!!!"
1111,poor,I got a 5 on the AP Exam and stuggled in Phillis's class. In my opinion was one of the worst teachers I ever had. He was extremely confusing and boring in class and was unable to clear up many of the questions asked. Had I not been in AP I would've done miserable. He also doesn't respond to any emails. Avoid him at all costs.
3920,good,"Take Symbols & Stories with Dr. Bauman! She is a great professor! She genuinely cares and wants to get to know her students! She makes class engaging, ineresting, modern, & purposeful! She never makes you do anything that is &quot;busy&quot; work, everything has a purpose! I'm definately taking another class (not a ARTH major) & keeping in touch with her!"
1287,good,"Fantastic teacher! She is very helpful and tells great stories.  As long as you go to class and actually do the readings, you will definitely get an A.  You will learn a lot from her class, even though it's on the larger side.  She's great!"
3285,poor,During the class if you have any questions she will not be able to answer them as she doesnt know what to do and doesnt know access.  She will yell at you and embarrass you in the middle of class as well. Grading is not consistent and constantly changes after you hand in assignments.
3276,poor,The worst professor ever. She does not deserve to be in a professional teaching position with George Mason.
3933,good,"Crazy, Funny Personality. She gets you interested in what she is talking about. Runs around the class, its from all the coffee. Her test are hard with alot of information. i enjoyed the class but would not take it again. It was hard being a gen ed!!!!! Nice lady overall. Attendence is mandatory, she takes roll everyday. Do not buy the book!!!!"
327,good,"Molumby is a great professor and  an good guy. I loved this class because he is such an interesting character. Though the class is a challenge, it's a college bio class that can be expected!"
1790,poor,"Most obnoxious annoying teacher around, grading scale is higher than normal, to get an A grade you need around 95.5% rediculous"
2490,good,"I LOVE BROWNING! Honestly, he's the best prof I had this year! He's such an amazing lecturer and very helpful when students need him. Seriously, I wish all profs were like him."
2006,good,Great professor. Really tries hard to make sure you understand the concepts. Definitely take a class with her.
2007,good,"Great Professor! easy n fun, class is interesting."
1858,good,"i really enjoyed this class because she does a lot to make it interesting. her variety of multimedia and class activities is the best part. she definitely wants her students to be interested in the subject, so pay attention and you're fine. read every now and then, do the concept quizzes and surveys and it's easy to get an A."
4124,poor,"He is purposefully intimidating.  His projects are completly unreasonable.  Why assign something soo difficult that you may have to curve in the end &quot;for the lucky few.&quot;  If you want to learn and possibly keep the GPA for which you toiled, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.  You are assumed a slacker until proven innocent."
312,good,"First and foremost, whoever wrote the comment about his stance should be ashamed of his/herself. Get over your bitterness and grow up! Molumby was a fantastic professor who found ways to keep his students interested. Most of my colleagues would agree. He is more than fair and if you're willing to put in the work your grade will reflect it."
832,poor,"Nice Guy. Bad Professor. If you're a math major or are extremely good in math, youll be fine. For the rest of us, plan on struggling as u try to learn on your own. Class is a waste of time. I wonder how the math department could hire such crappy professor."
3079,good,Best teacher in the world!
1201,good,"Great teacher, very helpful, shows genuine interest in students!"
3631,good,"i went to every class but the material is so boring, i pretty much fell asleep every class too. but, i still got an A. her tests come straight from the slides, which she posts online. the book is also really helpful. overall, good teacher. take her!"
3093,good,This man loves his math :)
2134,good,"Professor Brym is good at explaining concepts and he is pretty clear with his ideas. However, he is not a nice person and he doesn't care about his students. He is stuck up and has an ego the size of Russia."
2209,good,Had this prof 7yrs ago as my very first lecturer. Very knowledgeable friendly and impressive in the way he lectures. I think he is an inspiring teacher to have and would recommend him to anyone considering soc as for tests talk to your ta's things can be managed!
3640,good,"She is a great professor and explains the concepts in the book well. Her exams are alittle tough, but if you learn the material you'll do fine. Also getting the old exams are EXTREMELY helpful b/c they are very similar to new versions. I would defiantly recommend taking her!"
1481,poor,I can not for the life of me understand this man. He complicates everything. I'm almost positive that if he were to teach my addition and subtraction right now he would make me confused.
777,good,"Good guy and teacher, people just hate on him because they're stupid and get bad grades..."
799,poor,"Only reason I passed this class was because he broke his hip and Adena Calden stepped in to teach.  Rambles on for 20minutes before he gives you the one equation you need.  So hard to follow.  Old School teaching methods. Horrible jokes.  Take 128H with Calden.  Its honors but it will be easier. If you do take it, buy the book and teach yourself."
54,good,He is simply a super good. He is hilarious and knows how to teach the material he aimed to cover within the planned time which is extraordinary for me.   
2972,good,"A very funny guy. Extremely warm and friendly, always ready to do whatever he must to help students succeed. He will write you a reference letter (guaranteed) if you do well in his course. If you study, you will do well. He is also very generous and adjusts marks at the end of midterms and final exam."
1920,good,I had lots of fun! There's lots of in class demonstrations..and the grading is pretty easy so you can just enjoy the class!
4079,poor,far the worst teacher ever. hate this guy.
3389,average,"I would take this professor if your an accounting major, but that's it.  Her final was ridiculous and there wasn't enough time to complete it.  Take another teacher if at all possible."
1701,poor,He teaches the history of math than the math itself. Should reccomend a new book with solved examples of what he teaches in class. He is a a great guy with a good sense of humour. He could improve if he solves more math than talk about it.I suggest he should come to class if he cant speak and stop using sign language.
2161,good,Great!
1136,good,"Material is hard and confusing at first but repetition and PRS questions that build upon each other make it all clear.  Focus is definately on understanding conceptually how systems work, rather than nonsensical memorization of specifics...Challening, but definately a rewarding class, esp. if you plan to go further into Biology"
987,good,Randy is without a doubt my favorite professor starting off my freshman year. He is passionate about biology and makes it his goal to instill the same appreciation in his students. His lectures are rarely boring and he can makes a lecture on signaling the funniest part of my day. Exams and Fri. quizzes aren't too difficult consisting of mostly T/F.
3713,good,"She's a nice lady, but you can tell she just flips through the same lectures every semester without attempting to get to know students. It's an easy A, but to the point where she wastes your time with this elementary school science. Also checks participation (super annoying for a 50- min 3x/week class). She makes you buy the $$ labbook she wrote"
3386,average,Her head bobbles when she talks.. she's mean but she knows what she's talking about.. I guess. ::bobble::
3057,poor,Avoid this teacher AT ALL COSTS.
1394,good,She's real nice and funny.  Her class isn't difficult because she's a good teacher.
2637,poor,No Comments
768,poor,very boring and not clear. did not fare well in his class
4140,poor,"He knows his stuff but is the biggest jerk in the entire world.  Dont ask questions because he will make you feel stupid.  His class covers very indepth material very quickly.  He is a harsh grader, shows no sympathy to working students and loves to try and catch honor code violators."
3897,good,"She is clearly the best prof I have ever had. The textbook is not necessary. Attend every lecture and take all the notes from her class and you will be fine. She gives you a study guide, and with the notes you took, and some you can get online, you will do fine. Her class is not an easy A unless you put some effort on it. Love her class"
285,good,"Molumby is the man! His lectures are actually really interesting and he's a pretty funny guy. Labs and clicker points are easy. Tests are a bit tougher but as long as you get some old tests, you'll be fine. He also drops your lowest test and makes an 86% an A. Overall a great class"
4341,poor,"I definitely changed my major after sitting in Dr. Dennis' class. I'm such he's a really nice man, but he's a HORRIBLE professor. He's boring as h***, and I think he takes pleasure when his students fail his tests. Avoid him like the plague, and take this class with someone else."
428,good,"Even if the material is difficult, it's still fun to try to undress him with your eyes.  This guy's HOT!"
2332,good,he keeps the class interest quite high
2717,average,No Comments
2079,good,good lectures
722,poor,Talks too quietly.  Goes off-topic too often.  Is too hard-headed. Unwilling to compromise.  Makes jokes that only he finds funny.
951,good,"Loved the class, she is a funny teacher who will do anything you need. She will not let you fail if you try. if you come to class you will get a A, but class is interesting so you will want to!"
3589,average,"Ok, here's the straight dope. Do not take her class if you are just filling out gen-ed requirements. I repeat. DO NOT TAKE HER if you are looking to get an EASY A. This was how I went into her 104 class and ended up working really hard for a B! Take EVPP instead. She makes Bio too difficult. You have been warned."
2262,good,Interesting and informative course.
989,good,"Randy is absolutely hilarious and makes lectures bearable. He really tries to make the concepts as comprehensible as possible and genuinely wants students to preform well. The Friday quizzes are typically easy, but multiple true false exams can be confusing at times. Overall a great class and good professor!"
1759,average,He's a very outgoing teacher.
3187,poor,"She was OK, clearly she knows her stuff but isn't that well at teaching and if you ask her a question she tells you to read the book or asks if you were in class when she taught it-  kinda defeats the purpose of her teaching. Overall she is straightforward with what to expect for exams which are tough especially if you're not an acct major. "
326,good,"He's really cool.His research w/ bees & wasps is pretty good too.He also collects mutant cats.His exams are hard and I have no advice on how to study for them.I have an A in his class, but the amount of effort that you have to put in just for a low A is quite a bit.Although his class is tough, it prepares you for other classes.Good prof overall."
2608,average,"The classes were useless, the prof just read the PowerPoint. The tests were hard, but fortunately the marks were belled up in the end."
1383,good,Best class. She's pretty much inspired me to major in psychology. She's really interested in the material and it shows.
1724,good,"ppl are u guyz serious&#63;&#63;&#63; Cook is not that bad, I mean hes funny and enthusiastic to teach. The only problem i had with him was that most times he spent alot of time explaining an simple problem which made it more confusing. Overall his class is not bad at all."
1086,poor,"The only thing that got me through this course was my memories of what I learned in AP biology. He is very unclear during his lectures and not very helpful. Even when you do ask questions, he refuses to give the straight answer. He does not teach from the book and cannot give you chapters to read. I wouldn't recommend Phillis to anyone."
3792,good,"Lecture slides are posted online but contain no helpful information. She is a nice woman, but the class is not that interesting. The labs are rediculously long and sometimes require more time than the 2.5-3 hours given. The lab-write ups are excessively long and repetitive."
341,good,You can get a good grade in this class if you attend all the lectures and go over practice exams. He's funny and will help you memorize material lectures are worth attending. The book is helpful but labs are more important on exams.
147,poor,Molumby is the most poor guy at uic. he is the WORST WORST. i feel like bios 100 is much better than 100. this guy wants you to know every single detail on 200+ slides. the only part is old questions shows up in the exams but the poor part is he doesnt provide the answer key for old exams LOLOL. WORST CLASS EVERRR. AND THE TA GRADES HARSH. NO LIE
3668,good,Easy professor as long as you study you'll end with an A. No cramming or you'll get burned.
1107,poor,"He's an good person. Very funny, very friendly, overall a great guy. BUT he is not a very good professor. Class is EXTREMELY difficult / very hard to understand. He does not fully explain anything. My class has already taken 2 exams and it is MONTHS into the semester, and he has not posted ONE grade. We don't know if we are passing or failing."

966,good,"Yes...just yes. Definitely take 310 with him ASAP, because his feedback on resumes, cover letters, etc is invaluable. Nice guy, approachable, funny(very Canadian), great teacher, willing to help with anything. The school is really lucky to have him."
4164,poor,"All my friends who took this said the same thing - Wolf tries to come off smarter than she is.  The TAs generally stink and just run exercises.  However, if you can get Professor Markin as a TA, he is good.  But Markin does not TA this anymore.  My friends who have him for the classes he actually teaches love him - why can't he just teach this?"
3872,good,"Professor Bauman is a great professor. She lets you know from the start how she wants things, and how the course will be. You probably should go to lecture, there are things she says that will be on the exams that won't be in the book or slides. There are daily ""tickets"" where she asks questions to see if you read. Recommend her if anybody!!"
2203,good,great prof. probably one of the best courses at u of t. brym is one of the best public speakers i've known. the course is easy to do well in as long as you do the readings.
3483,average,"Her slides were the exact same thing as the book, so there wasn't a lot of detail readily available. Despite showing up to lecture almost every class, I still was lost. I barely passed."
661,poor,Should've passes on this class. Terrible. Did not learn anything. He graded on a downward scale. RUN!
1002,good,I loved Randy's bio 151 class this  year. He's such a great guy and seems passionate about what he's teaching. Theres 3 exams plus the final which are tough but if you put in the time and utilize the SI sessions you should do ok. He gives quizzes every friday but they are pretty clear cut. Overall I really enjoyed his class and would recommend him.
4054,poor,"I happen to know some high level folks (guess who) at SRA and other major industry partners, who would be mighty displeased with the current direction of the courses offered by the individual in question. Have a great day!"
3965,good,"Amazing teacher. She somehow made Art History seem important, which is rather impressive. I know nothing about art, but she made the class fun, interesting, important, and even relevent. Some really dry assigned readings, but she makes up for it with her lectures. Take her!"
3676,good,"i took this class over the summer, and LOVED her teaching style. She is very animated and keeps you interested. Besides, her notes are extremely comprehensive and her tests are fair."
4144,good,Hard class in general but you can understand what he is saying. Hes the better teacher out of the 2 professors that teach this class. Hes funny because he curses alot in class. Dont get cought cheating because he is good at catching cheaters. The project is really hard so manage your time wisely....
1879,average,"overrated.  picks favorites, doesn't give off a genuine, kind vibe."
4272,good,Prof. Wolf is a good one. She sometimes yells at students if they pack up before she finishes her lecture. Her tests are fair if you do the reading...the thing is this text is boiring to read...no way to read on a regular basis...
1203,good,Randy is the best professor I have ever had.
1990,good,"Human Biology is super easy. If you go to every class and pay attention you shouldn't have to study or read the textbook. You can skip all the classes and still have a good grade but then you'd have to read and study. She makes it easy to understand with videos/demonstrations/personal stories, etc."
24,good,"She's great. I don't understand why anyone would say she is boring or hard on grading. I love this class. It's interesting, very fair, and I don't know of anyone in the class who doesn't participate or who doesn't like the class. She's one of my favorite professors"
4270,good,"Dr. Wolf's lecture is pretty easy and clear.Her exmas are easy, and the text is easy as well.Compared to other SOM classes, her class is doable. I liked the book....it's just simple and doesn't confuse people."
3182,good,"What's up with the final exam being on another level than the regular exams? Seriously, that final was excessively difficult. The other three exams aren't that bad. But be prepared to get a full letter grade lower on the final. You learn all the concepts on connect. Watch the narrated slides and do the homework and quizzes over and over."
3274,poor,"DO NOT TAKE - absolutly avoid at all cost. Will not teach you - will try to &quot;get you&quot; - loves going to board meetings - have a feeling that she hates everyone and wants them to fail. Yells, very intimidating. Just one of the worst teachers I have had in my life - and I have had many :) I just sorry I took it"
3612,good,"I LOVE HER!!!!!Trust me, you want her for a professor---not only does she teach the material very well, she cares about each individual student, and is very patient when we don't understand the material. Also, she is passionate about what she teaches so it's fun going to class.     :)"
875,poor,He doesn't really help you learn.  Shouldn't rely on him to help you pass tests.  Expects you to know a lot more than he's covered.  But still a guy that keeps the lecture lively.
4176,good,"Professor Wolf is a nice lady.  Her class in crystal clear not hard at all.  If you want an A buy the book and study the ppt slides.  I just studied the slides and got a B+.  She has a bad rap, but the class isn't that hard just takes a lot of time."
938,good,I absolutely love this professor! She is amazing and is very passionate about the criminal justice system. She will do whatever it takes for students to succeed in her class. Class is always interesting and never boring. TAKE HER!!
2687,average,I feel like she's out to get me.  Can't stand her voice.
2394,good,"explains everything well in class. available for lots of extra help. he means well for his students, but his tests murder you. studying past tests don't help you much. i dont know how i passed his classes, but both organic and physical chem were hard. overall good humored, teaches chem in a way that makes you love the subject (until the exam/tests)"
3948,good,"The best and most memorable class I have taken at Mason.  The professor was so enthusiastic and energetic, it was impossible to miss a thing.  Going to class was like watching a play, you could almost picture everything.  She gives you all the basic info you need to sound smart at a museum.  Fair, but come to all classes if you want an A"
4382,poor,He is very boring and his lectures dont make sense sometimes. His tests are not that hard you can pass with an A like I did but its pretty hard.
385,good,I would say he's a great professor. He's empathetic about the grading. He has a very good sense of humor. Hot personality! Something that spices up the lecture and makes you stay awake for once!
3601,good,"Moderate class...lectures are somewhat boring. If you study the PowerPoints and the book you should pass with a B...but this is not a class that you can slack in, there is A LOT of material so be prepared to study!"
3950,good,If you ever get a chance to take Prof Bauman DO IT!  She is one of the best professors that I have ever had at George Mason!  Her lectures can get a little long but she's a little ball of fire!  Amazing woman!  AMAZING!
3453,good,"she is a good prof., but make sure you do all your homework!!!"
2291,good,"very interesting lectures, however he can be bias at times"
3291,poor,"She's a joke...not much more than that. She doesn't teach, she just barks and tells you you're wrong...but not WHY or HOW to fix it. She builds exams in hopes she can fail as many people as possible. She doesn't attempt to help people, unless it's one of her few favorites. Avoid at all costs."
936,good,"I can say with complete confidence that this is the best college instructor I have ever taken. She is very personable, interesting, and brilliant. Without a doubt best professor at UWG.  Take her....for anything. She's very attractive too! ;)"
4071,good,"Initially, I was open to his style and felt he had a lot to teach. After being in the class... I changed my mind. The work was something my friend who is halfway into his Ph.D. thought was hard. He grades harshly... the work is ridiculously hard (although the detail is nice) and he does not seem that considerate of others."
2360,good,"One of my favorite Prof's at UofT. Great pace, passion for what he does, easily approachable, but the tests he writes are undoubtedly the hardest out of all 1st year profs. "
201,good,"I found his lectures entertaining, class doesn't drag and moves a comfortable pace as long as u print the notes ahead of time, u do need to hear and understand what he is saying more than writing down it down(stories do show up on exams). He is very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. His tests r annoying cause multiple correct answers."
1332,good,EASIEST A  OF MY LIFE
3016,poor,"Very deceiving course, it's interesting but the amount of information you have to learn is beyond undergrad.  Overall an average course, with a very odd professor."
2708,average,"MacKay is not a horrible professor, despite first impressions. Yes, he speaks with a monotone and tends to suddenly raise his voice and drop it immediately to an inaudible level; making him hard to follow. However, his lecture notes are very organised and his tests are fair to make up for the frustration earned from his presentations."
1934,good,unpleasant and superficial
935,good,"Best professor in my entire college career! I've taken her for I know at least 5 or more classes. You learn so much from her classes and she's the reason I want to get into the field of Criminology.  As far as the violent crime class, midterm and a final. They are both essay style but go to class and you will do great! I got an A!"
2418,average,his tests are brutal. Needs to provide harder question examples in class to better prepare us for what he's going to test us on.
566,good,cool guy
1854,good,"amazing teacher. 4 tests, best 3 count. online quizes count as 40% but you can take them multiple times to get a 100. gives extra credit and there are no questions that aren't on the study guide. overall amazing woman. LOVE HER!"
3786,good,i loved her! she's a really good teacher. if you google her class and her name you can find all the powerpoints filled in so you dont always have to go to lecture. kind of a boring class but she's so nice.
2872,average,"I went to his office hours to ask questions about the following weeks reading and he told me he wont answer my questions until after the lecture. Like what? Literally the lowest grade I've gotten (72) but yet I worked my ass off. I think he's actually a good lecturer, but his exams are difficult. If you suck at M/C (I suck) then pray its a dif prof"
3030,poor,No Comments
3808,good,"Not sure who is rating here. If you are breathing and attend class there is no way to fail. Yes, it is BORING, but she does everything except hold your hand to get you to pass. She gives study guides, helps out of class, offers lots of EC, and the material is EASY. Yes, you have to go to class, but if you don't want to do that, why are you here&#63;&#63;"
2467,good,"He's a really cool/funny guy, always sipping from the mug and fixing his long flowing locks. But fun aside he's a good lecturer, really stresses the important concepts in the lectures, goes over them many times ... it's too bad I fell asleep in a lot of his lectures :P"
1645,poor,DO NOT take calculus 128 with this professor. I've never been so confused about math in my life and he does not care to help students understand the material he is teaching. Cook is a really sweet and funny old man but certainly doesn't know how to teach. Material on hw and exams are completely different from what he teaches. Avoid his class!!!
3341,good,Hylton is a great accounting professor.  She keeps the class interesting because she is very enthusiastic and has a good sense of humor.  The subject is tough so you have to keep up with it on your own but she teaches with clarity so attending every class is a real help.  Ive taken Prof. Hylton for three different Acct classes so I'd recommend her!
2861,poor,No Comments
1792,poor,"If you are interested in psychology take psych 100 with another professor. She rambles to herself about only jokes she can understand and she is all over the place, which makes the class miserable. Trying to follow her should be a course in and of itself. She is always unavailable and doesn't care about her students at all. AVOID THIS CLASS!"
1430,good,She is really friendly - and as a note she always needs undergrad TAs for her psych 100 classes which is a great opportunity for a recommendation and prep for GREs
2826,poor,prof appears to have little interest in teaching.  arrives late to class with an untidy appearance.
3100,good,"Had him over the summer for pre-college. I went in with a really sucky AP calc AB background and came out being freaken good at calc. Honestly, he's hard. His tests are hard, and if you fall behind, you're screwed. But he does teach, so if if you can keep up, you should be golden."
3638,good,"Dr.Fondufe is full of energy and very enthuastic about teaching. She is very nice and helpful &quot;IF&quot; you go to her office hours. Her tests are really HARD and she drops the lowest test grade:). Oh yeah, she plays a lot with her tests so be careful about that ;)...Go to class, read the book and you'll do fine!!!"
1013,good,"Randy is an good guy, don't get me wrong, but there's no way an intro Bio class should be this difficult. He focuses to excess on cell biology and mutation without really teaching about the normal system first, so unless you have a strong background in biology, this class is gonna be an uphill battle. Weekly quizzes and 3 exams (no surprises)"
1928,good,No Comments
3531,poor,"terrible professor, doesnt know what she is doing. she asks for 15 minutes after every lecture to finish the topic. shes so unorganized dont take her"
3056,poor,"CHEM 36 isn't that bad, but 130 is hell. Moylan is the worst teacher I have ever had. If you try to ask him anything he will get pissed off."
3882,good,"Highly recommend! I was so nervous to take this class but I had no choice since I needed it for my ged ed. Dr. Bauman is an incredible professor! She made a subject I had no interest in VERY engaging and I loved it! It is definitely manageable to get an A (unless you're lazy). If you respect her & her class, she will respect & help you."
126,good,"He has an online note set with answers and such and normally if you just do that you should be able to do well on the test.  However, going to class has it's benefits because he will go over something that isn't explained too well or doesn't have an answer in the note set book of his.  All his tests has cheat sheets.  (test number + 1) Also, no HW."
3298,poor,The best way to pass this course is to memorize all the REA models. She does not explain material well.  Her lectures was reading slides. You have to work on your own to past this couse.  Having a friend from the other section will help. :-)
2935,poor,I was really excited to take this class but it was such a disappointment. The tests were unfair and the readings were incredibly repetitive.
1347,good,shes good!!!! not only does she dress wicked cute but class is very interesting as well. there is also a lot of extra credit which is great. A++
3055,poor,Moylan is the worst teacher the world has ever seen. He gets pissed off if you ask him a question.
355,good,"He's a good professor and is interesting. Try to sit in the front of class. He tends to not keep the mic up to his mouth.  Memorize his POWER POINTS and you will be fine.  He makes bio interesting with his asides.  They appear on exams so pay attention (dont take notes on them, general interest in what he's saying should be enough for tests)."
4099,good,You have to go to class and read before each class because of the pop quizzes.  He seems intimidating in class but if you actually do the work he will cut you a break.  USE HIS OFFICE HOURS FOR THE PROJECT! He was extremely helpful when I went in.  Over all he is a good guy who wants you to learn
2730,average,"Mackay is a nice person. But he doesn't give a crap to students who dont' try to help themselves first. That's what I feel. He would joke in class too because he does have a sense of humor. Just remember, he's real smart, and he doesn't see why we cant b."
827,good,he da best
1639,poor,"Cook is a really bad prof. I had never taken Calc before, I attended every single lecture and took many notes. However he repeats the same lecture over multiple times and there were things on exams he never taught in class. He spends more time taking to his calk (literally) and reciting Shakespeare than teaching calc."
3040,poor,No Comments
984,good,A professor that alters my view to biology completely. I appreciate his patience and caring for students who seek for help.
4373,average,"Don't bother coming to class, just read the book and memorize all theories, people, and events. You learn a lot, but requires A LOT of reading. He's gotten easier! But you have to do a lot of work to make a good grade!"
2188,poor,"Tests were multiple choice, testing on your memorization of minor details in text and lectures. He drones on and on. I don't recommend taking him, but it may be inevitable."
4021,good,"One of the best teachers GMU currently have. He knows a lot and shares all sorts of knowledge, not just what you need for class but for real world too. Take VERY GOOD notes and you'll be good. No drinks/food and no talking in class and you'll be on his good side!"
2443,good,I absolutely adore Professor Browning! He is very engaging and the fact that he's cute doesn't hurt either.
362,average,I hated this class. The exams are really tough and if you know that you wont study for this class in advance dont take it. Not a slack off class
2349,good,"a nice prof, but the lecture...."
345,good,"This was a great class. The tests were really hard; but, the instructor was good, in a scary intense sort of way."
3243,poor,"Honestly, one of the hardest teachers I've ever had in my life. She's not helpful and pretty rude. Does not know how to teach the subject, and only goes through the slides. If it wasn't because of the book I would had fail the class. AVOID AT ALL COST"
4011,poor,"Caused me to change my major because I disliked him so much and his material is in the whole program. He doesn't try to teach, doesn't care about people learning, he just cares about making it as difficult as possible. Tests always have a lot of obscure and vague questions that weren't well discussed in class. Acts like everyone is stupid but him."
711,good,"I absolutely loved Dr. Sacher. She is funny and brilliant which made the class fun and interesting. The work is easy and the class is great to hear everyone else's drama and tell your own. Through the journals she requires every week, you feel like you have a personal therapist to talk to."
3205,good,"Professor Hylton is fast paced and expects you to work hard. If you come into this expecting to be spoon fed material, you're out of luck. She's a great teacher with great experience and if you just do what she says and STUDY, you'll be just fine. Don't be afraid to ask for help, she does care."
3917,good,"Great class if you are into art history. But be warned, it is a hard classs. I got an A but had to study my a** off. Also, she does not grade any of the tests herself. Her assistant does, and makes a ton of mistakes. Check your test twice and go see her."
4244,good,"Really good teacher. Interactive lectures, gets class involved in discussion, real world experience and examples.  Negative: writing assignment or quiz EVERY class prior to lecture to make sure you prepared for class. I understand her approach but this fores you to attend EVERY class or take major hit to your grade. Otherwise GREAT."
3720,good,"Largen is enthusiast and passionate about her subject. The class is boring but if you come to class and actually halfway listen, you'll ace everything (you can be on Facebook all you want, she doest care- but you won't pass her tests). If you're looking for that easy science lecture where you can skip some friday classes, this is it."
10,good,"I learned a lot. Don't expect this to be a blow-off class though. Attend class and participate in discussion and she will like you. She can be sarcastic but it's funny. Paper topics can be confusing, but just ask her for help! She takes into account if you care about your grade, once she knows that she will help as much as she can"
3793,good,"If you need to complete lab science requirement, this is definitely the easies class to take. Dr. Largen is pretty nice, book is useless, classes are helpful for exam but if you miss some its not a big deal. Overall  its a pretty easy class."
2116,good,"There's a lot of ambivalence towards Brym as a lecturer and a lot of that stems from the fact that there are 2 kinds of people who take this course: those who want a credit, and those who are actually interested. If you are actually interested in sociology, you'll do well. If you're not, this course can be brutal. Do the readings and you'll be fine"
1834,good,Great experience...the class material was pretty tough though and too many chapters are covered on the exams at one time. However I made out with a -B. You purchase the notes for the class with the book...it's not necessarily a good thing because taking notes helps you study. 2 words: FLASH CARDS! They got me through the course. Extra credit too.
793,poor,"By all accounts, an poor professor. He's very unclear, and his jokes probably got old around the dawn of indoor plumbing. Run while you can."
4349,good,Sitting in class feels like the biggest waste of time. He just keeps talking and talking. But he's a real nice guy though. I get all my notes by looking over the shoulder of the girl that sits infront of me.
2802,average,"This guy is probably not a bad guy, and he's probably very smart, but I did not get anything from his course. Seems like him and I both hated the class. I was trying to understand what he was saying, but he wouldn't even answer my questions properly. I gave up and rote memorized past exams and got 100%. Worst class ever."
2674,good,"her style is motivating and confident, material relevant.  excellent."
94,good,He rocks no nobody teaches like him he's simply the best
129,average,nice prof.
2891,average,he asks detailed questions on test. you have to memorize statistics  
2371,good,"he's a great prof, inspirational..."
3513,good,"Overall, Professor Fondufe was a great professor. She is easy to understand and helpful. There are three tests, a regular exam, midterm, and a final. She posts study guides and powerpoints on blackboard, if you do those you will be fine! She is a great professor!"
3237,poor,"Avoid her unless you wanna screw up your GPA. she is the most difficult and aggressive person in the world. she didn't even try to help you at all even though I consider myself a hard studying student. In a word, she don't know how to teach and didn't even try to improve her teaching style and is a super mean person."
3228,good,"She is strict and doesn't play around but she will offer explanation, but it'll be short and to the point. I didn't really depend on her lectures to learn, taught myself through Connect. Tests are easy as long as you really know the material, you can't half ass the studying. Didn't touch the book, Connect has more than enough resources."
4326,poor,Prof uses Soci 101 as his soapbox to preach about black history and relates every single thing in class to civil rights/black issues. Def not what I signed up for. he sends out chapter terms and thank goodness he does bc he barely goes ovr any of it in class. evrything I got from the class I read in the book while doing the study guide. DON'T TAKE
3874,good,She's the most amazing professor here at GMU. A down to earth person. She makes you think outside the box and respects your opinion.  She inspired me to minor in Art History . A very dedicated professor. 
2263,good,Loved sociology.  Everybody should have to take it... makes better people.  Brym lectures very well but is not the most helpful.  Overall a great course.
1900,poor,"i hated this lady....worst teacher ever, completely crazy and talks to herself more than she teaches...doesnt know how to use a computer at all either...avoid her at all costs"
3443,average,"Tests are difficult and very detailed.  Accounting is a difficult subject, but she makes it even harder."
3765,good,Pretty much slept through class and got an A.  If you don't get an A in this class you need to do some self re-evaluation.  Teacher is real nice too!  Very helpful and has a positive attitude
3230,good,"Teaches very fast. The only way to do good is to put a bunch of time into learning how to do the journal entries ect. If you actually try and put in some time its an easy A. Work hard, study hard, and you will not fail."
1932,good,Always sparked interest in the subject matter
3469,good,"Literally, if you study her power-points, you will get an A. i skipped almost all of her classes, and aced her tests. just do her study guides and her power points has so much information, you are bound to get an A."
3375,poor,"Hands down the worst professor I have ever had. She knew nothing about the subject. She gave vague instructions for the project. She couldn't help me with Excel questions to complete the project because she didn't know how to do it herself. She wasn't thorough. She didn't care whether you learned or not, just don't bother her. She is TERRIBLE!!!!!!"
2912,good,"the Social Inequalities course was extremely straight forward, a good intro course that opens your eyes to not only social problems, but solutions too! You don't actually need to attend all the lectures to pass.. just do the readings and understand the basic concepts (of which there's about 5)"
1865,good,"she knows what she is doing, uses a powerpoint presentation in class for the lecture and show videos', study your notes and make sure that you buy the book, her test are not hard if you study. sometimes she gives one question that is going to be on the test as the daily double.,she knows what she is teaching about psy."
1658,average,"He knows the material, he just teaches it different then the other teachers.  If you took calc in high school, you'll be fine.  and if not, just go to a different lecture.  he does help with some things and you can always ask him for extra help.  fairly easy class overall"
516,good,"As an Anth major I found this class fairly easy.  Read the Angel notes, pay attention in class, and do a little memorizing before tests and you'll do fine.  Very funny prof. and easy to get along with if you at least put some effort into his class."
1857,good,"Don't be tricked into thinking you can skip class. The lectures seem like they are made for 3rd graders, but there are &quot;in-class activities&quot; given randomly that are worth a good portion of your grade. Also, do your concept quizzes cause they're easy and you need them for your grade."
2645,average,"Beware if the course average is too high going into the exam, as she will try to screw you over by throwing in a long answer question or two that you cannot answer entirely correctly (hello part marks) with what you learned from the text and lectures."
2243,good,"for classes of the given size, he's incredibly caring and responsive... lectures can get boring, but the book is ALWAYS boring!"
1277,good,Easy class with an good professor. Definitely need to take time and study for tests if you want an A but it's worth it. 
2336,good,Extremely helpful and quite caring.  Very organized.
950,good,"This class was good, I really enjoyed it. She is a wonderful professor. If you try, you'll do fine in her class. I pulled out a B and honestly didn't try very hard. She has unannounced writing assignments over your book, if you want to good on these you need to read, but its still not mandatory. Definitely recommended!!"
3650,good,"Very animated!  Personality makes lectures tollerable.  Tests are thorough and difficult.  They really test your knowledge, but fairly.  Gives notes online.  Read book and study these, know your sh*t, and you'll do fine."
3934,good,"Crazy, Funny Personality. She gts you interested in what she is talking about. Runs around the class, its from all the coffee. Her test are hard with alot of information. i enjoyed the class but would not take it again. It was hard being a gen ed!!!!! Nice lady overall. Attendence is mandatory, she takes roll everyday."
1120,good,"Good teacher, but his class is more analysis and actually understanding things than memorization.  You need to go to class, is the only down side.  but if it is your major then definitely take him over other teachers.  He is in general a helpful professor, who wants you to do good."
2597,average,"oh well... I tried to like this prof. She's not bad person at all, but she and her tas are just not careful enough. Sometimes, her test questions could be misleading and they often have typos. Her lectures are completely useless, if you have take accounting before in high school. overall, I am satisfied because I did well at the end."
2204,good,Dr. Brym is an amazing prof. His textbook is well written yet some chapters difficult to understand. His tests are really fair and questions straight out of the book. You just have to read the chapters several times to absorb all the information. He replies quick if you send him email.
419,average,"WHAT A HARD CLASS! I took it as a pass/fail and recommend that everyone who's not a BIO major do the same thing. I heard he was hotter before (arthritis changed him), but I would still do him. I have a huge crush on Molumby. I wish I had a picture of him. He def turns the girls on!! Wow! MMMmuuaahhh"
922,good,I have had her for at least 5 classes. She is a great professor and is really there for her students I would recommend anyone to take her! It's easy because you actually enjoy listening to her and being in her class! Attendance isn't mandatory but I loved going to class. She really cares about her students and would help them anyway she can!
3485,good,"Fondufe gives good lectures that are easy to follow, and makes the concepts easier to understand.  Her test questions often resemble the study guide, however, her study guides are extremely long so lots of preparation is required to get a good test grade.  Very fair teacher and class."
477,good,"I took 3 classes with him, one honors cultural and two as honors options, hes a real cool guy real laid back, if you say something mildly intelligent hes as nice as can be. tests are mostly multiple choice"
2035,average,"Class is easy, don't buy the book, she gives you all the info you need in the lectures, and her outlines are on the web site. Don't take the class if personal info makes you feel weird because she relates the topics to her life and family and friens A LOT!"
3425,good,"Had her for 203 & 311. GREAT teacher, will help if you ask for it. She is harder than others for 203, but if you actually learn the material, 301 will be a cakewalk.  Accounting majors should definitely take her for 203. Easy A if you put forth a little effort."
1692,good,"It's not too difficult. Just study the material. Even if you're bad at math you can get a good grade. Just make sure youre not lazy. Most of my friends didn't do well  b/c they were lazy, not b/c the it was hard, bad instructor, whatever bs. ect."
3476,good,She's a great professor who genuinely cares about her students and has a true passion for the material she teaches. Dr. Fondufe can clearly articulate concepts by relating the subject matter to everyday life in an effort make the material easier to understand. She's a very animated lecturer and was approachable too. Totally recommend her!
3466,good,Dr. Fondufe never showed up to class without a vibrant outfit and lots of energy.  She is very interested in the course she teaches and wants you to understand.  Her entire lecture is from a ppt though so attendance is not mandatory.  DO the study guides and you'll ace her tests.  I would highly recommend.
1471,poor,"&quot;If a piece of glass has an acute angle, and you throw it at someone, it'll cut them! If it's an obtuse angle piece of glass, it'll just bounce right off of them!&quot; Take another class with another professor, for sure. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GUY!!"
2601,poor,"The worst prof in UT.  Very much the same as a housewife.  The pass tests can't be reference!!  Just read the ppt in class, and that ppt is from the textbook publisher!!  Useless lecture!"
1202,good,"Randy made me  love bio, and I am staying in the bio department because of him.  I hope that i can have him again sometime soon."
2438,good,A good teacher but gives hard tests. Clear.
2626,poor,"horrible...reads off slides, tests completely different."
1669,poor,"im pretty sure thurlow doesnt know how to even use a computer. yes im bad at math, however going to class doesnt help and neither does homework. he gives homework problems on wiley that dont come close to problems u see on exams he also posts homework assignments late.he doesnt post grades on spark, and you cant bring up your grade other than exams"
4240,average,she is hot. and her exams are too. very hard exams.
1970,good,I love this woman. She is adorable and it's obvious that she loves to teach. The tests are moderate. If you pay attention in class and study you will do well. She offers extra credit too! Take this class. It's great for non-majors!
3110,good,"Good Teacher, lots of proof, just be respectful and don't fall asleep in class. Do the homework and come to class and you'll do fine. -Calc in 3D"
2151,good,"Brym changed my life... Without him, I honestly think that I would have completely hated my first year of University.. I would take another course offered by him in a heartbeat.. Wish him the very best"
820,poor,"Do all the OWLS, get at least 7 out of 14 questions right on each of the tests, and you'll get a C. If you do worse you will fail. He makes that very clear. Go to the reviews before each test, they help a lot."
1997,good,"She is the best teacher. Bio 106 with her is the easiest/best class I have ever taken at any level of education. If you cannot manage  B in this class with all the extra credit, you should not be in college...minimal effort and you will get an A."
4304,good,"Professor Dennis, though his teaching styles are not what I'm used to, he's actually a very nice professor since I've started at Mason. He's very funny, and though most of the things that he talked about were on race and religion, I was intrigued in the class. If you need help in the class, use his office hours. I'm glad I did, and now I passed!"
3054,poor,"Moylan is a terrible teacher; avoid him and this class if at all possible.  First, the class is a ridiculous amount of work - more like 10 units, not 4 - and second, he doesn't teach anything.  So you're expected to teach yourself all the theory for everything.  And you're at a major disadvantage if you haven't taken 153 - so be warned!"
1248,good,"Tamara's Psych 100 is an easy class if you're willing to do the required work. Attendance is somewhat mandatory because of her ""pop quizzes"" on the reading assignments and she has weekly online quizzes as well. However, tests are super easy if you study the notes."
3452,poor,"Do yourself a favor, dont take her. And dont say I didnt warn you.  She hard."
2712,poor,we was very monotone. i think he just came out of the crypt or something and never saw the light hahhaa. he looks very scary and robotic.  i only wonder wat he does with his time when he's not teaching...maybe growing mushrooms in the darkness of his basement&#63;
992,poor,"Even with prior knowledge from AP Bio, his class is extremely difficult."
2190,poor,"Totally hard, multiple choice was horrible"
4107,poor,DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!
1046,good,"Phillis is a great professor despite being unpopular with some students. He would rather students learn to problem solve and think analytically than memorize facts. All exams include diagrams so you don't need to memorize. He is readily available to help students, runs weekly reviews. GO TO CLASS. He does NOT teach from the book. But read it anyway"
1888,good,shes honestly one of the best teahers i have ever had. i was so excited to go to class every single time becuase she was so outgoing and fun so she kept us alert and into it.
2469,good,took chm 138 with him last semester..he is a great prof....interesting lectures
2847,poor,The worst prof i hav ever seen !!!
615,good,"What can I say? Get ready to read, do homework, long tests, pop quizzes, and  4-5 essays (extra credit essay if you want to improve an essay grade). He is an good professor and he doesn't expect anything from you that he wouldn't do himself. If he made any mistakes, he would address it in the class and even compromise the syllabus if need be."
1318,good,"Extremely thorough presentations.  Goes over things more than once.  Personally my most interesting and favorite teacher of the semester.  Makes jokes and involves the class, very entertaining, kept me awake even at an early class time.  Tests were not the entire grade, and extra credit was available.  Reading is important."
1863,good,"Overall good.Picks favorites.Lame jokes.Extra credit good.Should definately go to lectures&gt;material in lectures-such as examples,videos,activities-is incorporated into exams.Bubbly lady during class,but she's different if you approach her at some other time...avoidant and a bit cold."
2343,good,"very helpful prof., but tests are often unfair"
2449,good,Really boring prof.
2136,poor,Brym is one of the worst professors I've ever had. His lectures and his textbook is full of ridiculous pseudo-science. He doesn't even have an elementary grasp of statistics. He's pompous and obnoxious. He needs a reality check and a new line of work.
4135,good,"Oh STFU everyone!  Professor Lyons explains the material really well, and gives you homeworks, and offers you help if you attend class.  The midterm is fair game since he explains well, plus a lot is from the homework.  The final is a combo of all that plus the remaining homeworks.  Start the project early and you'll do just fine. Excellent book..."
1772,average,"Nice guy, I went to nearly every class, when it came time for the exam, I realized I hadn't learned most of the material."
4363,average,"Okay, so he's not that bad. He's nice. I never went to class and barely studied and still got a B. So, if you want an A, go over the study guide he gives you, keep up with the reading cuz there's a s**t load, u dont wanna keep that till the last minute...and u should be fine. even if u dont go to class...u can still manage an A! it's tru!"
131,poor,"Incredibly condescending to students and the school in general. Constantly talks down about other programs as well as the engineering department.  Also brags about himself quite a bit, he's an annoying teacher who doesn't deserve this position."
3388,good,"I took the 2 1/2 hour class and it was worth it. We normally end at 9:20, not 10, and sometimes earlier. She teaches really fast, so make sure you read the chapter BEFORE the lecture. The material isn't that difficult, but be prepared to study a lot if you want an A. She definitely points you in the right direction for an A."
77,good,"saw his lectures online, this guy is amazing!! wish my college had teachers like him. his lectures made my first year so much easier. amazing guy!!"
2898,poor,100 multiple choice questions are probably not the best way to evaluate one's knowledge of the course material. He often runs out of time and still expects us to know the slides he skipped over and include them on the test material.
2052,good,Amazing!!!
3830,good,"A nice person who is so helpful, never condescending.  Just attend class and take notes and you'll do well; it's college, what do you expect&#63;"
724,good,No Comments
1314,good,"Tammy's mad cool. The class is based on points and she drops the lowest test grade. There are online quizzes duw every week and spontaneous writing assignments which kinda makes it mandatory to go to class. The classes are interesting. She uses relevant examples, videos, and class participation to help explain what she's teaching."
3592,good,Fondufe teaches extremely well but her exams are very tricky! She puts in a lot of tricky questions on her exams and quizes. I esentially studied and payed a lot of attention and got a B even though I thought I had a B+ for sure any way To get an A in her class you really have to study and comprehend the material not a walk in the park at all.
1851,good,I took this my very first semester. It's an easy A course but I got a B because of her poorly structured exams. She finally cleaned it up and I scored a 90+ on the last exam but the other two still made the final grade a B.
2317,poor,"Horribly dogmatic (re: sociology & his course); rather repetitive, too"
3604,good,Really nice lady; the class is a bit mundane but tolerable.
3907,good,She's good as every aspect!!!
1372,average,"Easy enough class, but Rahhal is possibly one of ditziest people I have ever come in contact with. She tries too hard to be cool. I could see her being a TA, but as a professor, I'm not impressed."
1855,good,"Very helpful. Passionate about the subject. Don't be fooled by the class title, it's a lot more interesting than you think. It's  also easier than you think to get a good grade in the class. Follow along, do online quizzes (easy...) and review the review sheet for the exam. Piece of cake. oh yeah, prof is good."
2965,good,he usually makes the students question their answers
1319,good,"By far one of the coolest teachers I've had so far. She makes the lecture enjoyable to be in. If you take Psych 100, get her class, you will not regret it."
2560,good,Very HOT!!!! :)
4308,poor,"The class itself isn't too difficult as long as you read the book and make sure you know all the important terms/concepts that he gives you. He is a very nice professor and likes to joke around in class, but his lectures are long, tedious and extremely boring. He stopped requiring journals in spring 2014 so I don't go to class very often."
3850,good,"Dr. Bauman is one of the best professors for Art History! She's super helpful and her lectures are hilarious and fun. Tests are straight from the lectures and super easy, but you do have to attend class, because she doesn't post powerpoints on black board."
3412,good,"Not as anal as people make her out to be, but is strict with rules, don't get me wrong. Nice woman, but old school methods make this course less enjoyable than it could be."
375,good,He's pretty funny i attended 80% of his classes and he was funny. he puts alotta stuff he says on the exam. he relates to the stuff in funny interesting ways that cant let u forget the material his exams are alot harder than murray but he keeps u focused more cuz hes not boring
1908,average,"teacher has gone insane!! in a good way, her class is interesting with creative new activities every morning, i love the mini clips she uses for her class, only the exams are some what difficult, everything else is a o k!!"
333,good,"Dr. Molumby if you're reading this - you are good professor, but those exams...not so good! Come on give us some break...you made 2 exams difficult, make this one reasonable....For other students reading this, read the book, it helps but really study his power points!"
3538,poor,Don't take her for BIOL213 cuz shes a completely different prof who doesn't know how to teach. She talks for one hour and fifteen minutes and still asks us to stay for 10 minutes more in the class. very bad professor
3615,average,I've never studied so hard for a class in my life. And I feel as if I'm a good student. I realized maybe advanced bio is just not for me.  Her tests were very hard to me. There were a LOT of notes and she wasn't great at explaining concepts. Also didn't really answer questions clearly.
2365,poor,ugh.
1604,poor,Ummmmmm.  If don't like hearing this 50 times a lecture don't register with him.
1118,good,King of Bio.
4279,good,"This is TRULY one of the best professors that I have EVER had! His lectures are amazing and you can learn so much from this man! His exams require a lot of writing, but they aren't hard. He also has you write along in a journal while he lectures. It was so relaxing to me and I would take him again in a heartbeat. GREAT professor!!!"
1943,good,"Judy is an good professor. Very clear in class and always interesting. I took this class because I heard it was easy, but it is also so interesting! You'll learn a lot about relevant things such as birth control, cancer, etc. Would definitely recommend anyone at UMass to take this class! Also, don't buy the textbook."
2958,good,good
3583,good,I never bought the text book and came to lecture 50% of the time and did pretty well cuz ALL her exam questions are from her slides. she's really helpful when you need help and she's pretty loud and energetic which is great for a 1st morning class
4358,poor,No Comments
3568,average,"She's poorly boring to the point you never want to stay in class. Her exams are worded horribly and she loves &quot;which of the following is not, or which of the following is true&quot; questions and her notes are disorganized. Overly complicates a 200 level class. Wouldn't recommend or take her again."
2376,average,Very difficult tests and exams. Textbook prep questions are useless preparation for his brutal tests. Interesting lectures. Do not recommend his classes if you are looking to achieve a grade above a 75. Humorous. Hardly available outside of lecture.
3974,good,"Great Professor.  If you have to take art history, she's the one to take it with.  Gives entire study guide over the course of the semester to make sure you come to class.  Don't bother buying the book.  It's expensive and I've never used it -- still got an A on midterm and final."
1342,good,"Pretty easy class. 6 exams (top 5 scores) go to the review before the test, the study guide has everything you need to know. Random in class writings for attendance and to see if you did your reading (only need to do HOCK book readings, not fieldman)short easy online quizes. very enthusiastic prof, take this class."
320,poor,"Molumby is one of the worst professors I've had at UIC. As a bio major, I was utterly annoyed and distracted by the way this man teaches this class.  He blabbers on for hours and hours, and makes incomprehensible metaphors, rather than saying the exact scientific terms.  He doesn't answer e-mails correctly but simply replies with cryptic messages."
1619,poor,He seemed a bit... lost at times. He speaks kinda softly and makes you sleepy. No problems to work on your own the double check in class. He just lectures and you sit there trying to frantically copy whatever nonsense he puts on the board.
3839,poor,"Terrible grader. Quoted from the professor: ""If I can take off points from something, I will"". Does not allow any form of extracredit under any circumstances, even if the student is struggling from the beginning."
2060,good,"She's a wonderful professor and my favorite biology professor in the five college area.  She's approachable, clear, and very funny. I would definitely recommend her to anyone."
2945,average,"I can't stand it when prof's make us by all their stupid textbooks so they can get a paycheck (like, American soc for Americans..what&#63;&#63;). He's not great at all, a total name dropper, sits on a high horse, has been teaching the same course for like 15 years or something. SOMETIMES he cracks a good joke...thats rare though."
2219,good,lectures were easy to follow...material was organized and structured...approachable...website was ALWAYS up-to-date...readings were relevant to real-life issues and interesting...clear speaker.
1673,poor,"Can't understand a thing he says. Thank goodness i took calculus in high school cause if i didn't i would be so lost. too bad he is the only teacher who teaches 128, which i am forced to take next semester."
1942,good,"Super easy only went to class 3 times you have to try to fail this class. Easy hw, easy exams, drops lowest grade, optional final, no attendance and easy extra credit assignments. Plus you actually learn some useful stuff. Win win win"
260,good,"Overall, I really enjoyed him as a professor and he got me more interested in ecology by the end of the class. A couple things, though... 1)He doesn't really use a mic. 2)His exams are tricky on purpose, but practice off old exams. 3) He has lots of seemingly tangent stories but learn to understand his point. 4)He promotes many of his own opinions."
3691,good,"Very clear on topics and material.  Material follows a logical sequence that is easy to understand.  Dr. Fondufe is great to come to with any problems you may be having, she is quite helpful and willing to explain."
2039,average,"She seems like a nice, short, older lady, but her tests are ridiculously hard. Her notes and packets help on half the questions, the other half of the questions make no sense, and its hard to narrow down the answers. No homework or papers though."
689,good,"She is really a great professor. I wasn't too excited about going to this class in the beginning but she made the class so fun and interesting it was enjoyable. Also, she takes you step by step in the research project so if you do what she tells you to do, it's hard not to get an A!!!!!"
901,good,"She is a very good and passionate professor. She really cares about her students and the world for that matter. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that she gave no powerpoints or anything to go by. She gave plenty of quizzes which were ok, I just wish she would have had power points or something. Other than that she's cool and funny!"
2306,good,Interesting and dynamic professor
2026,good,"HILARIOUS teacher, never laughed so hard in a class in my life.  The part of the class she taught (the final of 3 portions) was very easy as well."
2892,good,I'm currently taking my second course with him (SOC103) but really enjoyed SOC102 ! :)I really don't know what everyone is complaining about his lectures are interesting and the tests are pretty standard. He does ask a few statistical type questions but the majority are pretty straight forward. He is a great prof ! :)
138,good,He loves to make fun of people and that my kind of person.
1917,poor,No Comments
1828,good,"take psych 100 with her. she drops the lowest test, and they are all very easy. there is extra credit, and the HW is easy too. you have to pay a lot for the reading material which sucks, and she makes you buy her note onlines for class... it's a rip off, but an easy class."
1573,poor,"I could say a few things that would be deleted. This was the worst class ever. Just sign up for the class and teach yourself. Go to help sessions with TA's and do the OWLs. He is apparently very smart, but can't teach the stuff. His lectures are a waste of time."
319,poor,"Molumby is by far the worst teacher I have had while at UIC. I sit in the front row and try to pay full attention but half the time I'm so lost because most of his anectdotes are confusing and unhelpful. As prior comments have mentioned, his organizational skills are terrible making understanding the material nearly impossible."
653,good,"Very good teacher! One of the best at CTC. He's very clear about what he wants and is more than willing to help you if you are having trouble with anything. I'd recommend him to anyone taking English. I warn you though, he loves essays! So be prepared to write."
2137,average,This class wasn't too hard. Just read the txtbook and attend class and you're good to go. But there were a lot of things he presented in class that I didn't agree on.
3639,poor,"she seems nice but does not grade in accordance with the syllabus - says one thing and does another - not very helpful has few office hours, she prides herself on an over 1/3 failure rate in class (200 kids this semester) if you are a bio major you need to take her b/c there is no one else to take - not reccomended"
558,good,I got an A.  You really have to work for it though.
2187,average,Needs another method of testing because multiple choice just doesnt really reflect a student's learning.
112,good,"All my friends raved about how great he was, but I just didn't think he was that funny.  Attending lecture was certainly not necessary."
531,poor,"This class sucks. She READS her lecture notes, questions make no sense, and yes she is way too serious. I'd rather work 8 hours than sit in her class for an hour and a half (feels like you're in class for a day).  She gives way too much reading which by the way is hard to understand. Worst teacher...Avoid her at all costs!"
224,average,"Allan is one of the weirdest most out of this world professor. Dude is one smart cookie but he doe not like giving out the crumbs so everyone is left out on the knowledge portion. Make sure to get the book he trolls people to not read the book. You have been forewarned go and take the other guy, he hot though so girls take him and never look back."
723,good,"very cool guy,a lot of info and a very bright mind. Alpha male with brains."
3811,poor,"this class freaking sucks. she makes it impossible to pass the tests bc she stopped putting the notes online. even if you go to class, you cant follow her fast enough."
2883,poor,"If you take this course be prepared for a lot of rote memorization. Concepts are not difficult, but there is a lot of material. Lectures are long and not organized particularly well. He speaks much too quickly and it is often difficult to take down everything that he is saying. He openly mocks students questions and I dreaded his class every week."
4056,poor,"Just to keep this simple, this is the most horrible professor you can come across. Any good ratings you see on here, it is probably him trying to boost his image. He is absolutely HORRIBLE!"
1433,good,She was an good teacher. Her slides were easy to understand and her tests were basically on her slides.
2373,good,I liked his lecturing style a lot since he tends to cover things more thoroughly and he breaks down difficult concepts better than jik chin anyway).  The textbook questions generally do not reflect what is on the tests so skip textbook questions and get your hands on previous tests instead to get an idea of what ur in for. Overall a good lecturer.
3655,good,Study your notes and you should do fine.  Ther is plenty of material but at least you know what material to study.  Time is key to her class
3371,good,VERY HARD CLASS. you must study A LOT. must read the book and do the study guide problems and all hw problems for practice. shes an alright teacher though. definitely go to class and MUST go to labs or you will fail. but read the book!
3767,good,Super NICE
1458,poor,He is a terrible professor for average students. He does not simplify or break down concepts. He tries to teach his students as if they all had his masterful mindset for math. He unintentionally blocks the board often. It's baffling how a veteran professor would not have this basic presentation skill. He is willing to help students learn though.
3097,good,"Entertaining in a quirky way. Course material was rather difficult conceptually, but tests were mostly a matter of knowing which formula to apply and not messing up. Seems very fair. Recitations were boring re-teachings of lecture, but useful if you didn't understand lecture."
1415,good,good
2762,poor,No Comments
846,good,"The math isnt that hard, but the tests are fairly meticulous, but multiple choice! He is great guy, and will provide you with whatever help you need if you go to class.  a little confusing in class, and he has a habit of showing up late and letting the class leave anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes early every day."
193,good,He's a good professor. All you have to do is to study off of his powerpoints. That's the info that he puts on his exams. Enjoyed his class.
1464,good,"Don't let bad comments discourage you! This class is really simple as long as you attend weekly. Professor Rudvalis is extremely reasonable and very helpful. He explains things well and makes sure the class has no questions on the material. His tests aren't tricky at all. He lets you use a cheat sheet, and he also holds reviews. Unlimited hw tries"
2621,poor,"Just terrible...she attempts to appear nice, but really, she only reads off slides, and tests on different material...try to take it with someone else!!!...my gpa suffered dramatically!"
946,good,"She is the best professor I have ever had. She is so sweet, caring, & funny & will help you in any way she possibly can!! She makes class interesting and I actually looked forward to her class. If you study you will get an A. She loves sociology & it shows. You must take her if you get a chance. I would love to take her again! BEST professor at UWG"
2021,good,"She's a very good teacher and I would definetly reccomend her. I hate bio and felt she made the class as interesting as it could get and also gives a lot of examples you can relate to. She gives extra credit, even though it's one point every time she does it, it definetly adds up and can help your test grade."
2551,good,Cool guy : )
1629,poor,Cook has been at it a long time and is the definition of old school teaching. I was never great at Calculus so i went to 95% of lectures and still had a lot of trouble with the materiel. Effort outside the class is a necessity to get a good grade. 
2928,good,"Ok so his lecture are straight forward, easily to understand and follow. BUT, his first test was alright, not too bad, then he dropped a bomb for Test #2, the Multiple Choice section. It was BRUTAL - the questions were unncessarily beyond hard for a first year course! Unnnnreal."
117,good,"Tough class, but an amazing lecturer. Definitely gets concepts across."
645,good,"This class is totally good!  I learned so much about American history and literature.  My favorite authors we studied were Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Vonnegut, and Chopin.  Everett is really passionate about literature and made me appreciate it all so much more than I did before.  Take it!"
1870,average,Class is too simplistic.  Feels a bit embarassing.
3,poor,"Took the course as an elective for graduate school. She's very bias towards the Political Science students. Everyone else should forget taking her. The study guide she gives has nothing to do with the exam. Do not follow it. The book is boring and pointless, because she covers it in class. But, review the terms in the chapter."
74,good,"good guy. Was extremely funny , helpful, and clear in describing the subject."
1755,average,"He covers the same material for about 3 weeks straight.  Tests are pretty easy, but he isn't always clear in lecture.  Easy to get a good grade in his class."
467,poor,"Not the easiest class and he does not review for exams.  Very helpful to go to class for the notes.  I think about half the class dropped before the final exam because they weren't going to pass.  The only good thing was that this class also counts for a lab, so you're killing two birds with one stone.  I ended up with a C average."
3393,poor,Worst teacher ever. Worst class ever.  Take it at NOVA.
5,good,Amazing professor who really cares about her students. She really brought the class together and the course was really interesting.  Definitely expects a lot of work but will always go the extra mile to help you out if you put forth the effort.
1246,good,Tammy is a fun professor who loves the subject she teaches. There are 4 tests (no cumulative final) and she drops the lowest test grade. A LOT of extra credit offered - easy A.
919,good,"One of my favorite professors. Very helpful. Easy tests. This woman made me become a criminology minor. No attendance policy. If you're going to be late, don't come at all she takes 10 points off your final grade if you interrupt class."
2595,good,overall good
228,good,"Let me be frank, this is a college level course. Expect to study hard - all course material and then some. Alan is a terrific professor, and his office is always open to students that show initiative and have a genuine interest in the biology. Have respect for the course and your education, if you struggle with mechanisms and terminology, STUDY!"
1063,good,Does not respond to emails.  EVER
2590,poor,Her class are basically useless. She was extremely incomprehensible and unhelpful.
242,average,"MEMORIZE every minute detail of the PPT slides. Exams include the most obscure references. Do the reading too. Molumby/TAs will tell you to concentrate on lecture, but the reading is on exams. Frustrating class. Wish there was a better format. If you memorize, you'll just forget."
2946,good,Tepperman is a good prof! I personally like his sense of humor but a lot of people dont. His lectures are long with a lot of slides and he moves fairly quickly-the subject material is interesting at times and boring at others but Tepperman tries to keep everything going with his jokes. Tests are ok. Lectres can feel realy long but overall gr8 class
3578,good,"I had Fondufe for Bio 103 and I did really well in the class. But unlike Bio 103, Bio 213 was a different story. In that class SHE WAS HORRIBLE!!!! I expected the same teacher and same test from 103 but what I got was a disaster. She gets her test questions from a teacher manual and does not think to see if its a hard question or not! STUDY ALOT!"
1160,good,"I LOVE HIM!! He's my most favorite Bio teacher ever. His teaching methods are actually very helpful in understanding the material. The people who voted him as difficult or not very easy to understand, may not know the subject very well. He's able to give you an overall point at the end of the lecture; to see the forest from the trees. The quizzes and tests are tricky-IF YOU DON'T STUDY! The review sessions are for people who have no idea wtf is going on. Should be a 5 credit course tho w/ the nazi-like labs"
3660,good,"Very good teacher.  Well organized, straight forward.  Intimidating at first, but exams are not difficult.  Study exam notes."
3962,good,"Bauman is an amazing professor.  I had to take this course as a gen ed and I was dreading it.  She has a enthusiastic personallity that will keep you interested throughout the class.  She is funny and although her tests have no curve, she handout study guides over a month in advance.  Excellent prof...take her class!"
3508,good,"Fondufe is one of the best professors as Mason in my opinion. She is very passionate about biology. Exams can be hard, but you get what you put in. I recommend looking over the study guide and the powerpoints. She gives iclikers, so show up to class. Made biology interesting. She's always full of energy. Hands down, the best biology professor. "
2890,good,Teppermans class is pretty good and he's enjoyable to listen to. His class is fun and enjoyable and is really eye opening about how groups interact and how these interactions work with inequality. His tests are not super hard as long as you understand the main concepts and attend lectures. 
2563,poor,"Disorganized, unhelpful and condescending"
2671,good,"Zuliani rocks! she captivates the room with her energy. ppl if u dont like it, wake up - acct's just one big simple process!!"
1526,poor,"He is by far the worst teacher anyone could ever have.  He does not teach you anything, he is the most unhelpful teacher and he is the head of the department.   I would never ever recommend this teacher, he should replaced ASAP."
1605,poor,he does not know how to teach..he teaches the way its easy for him.. writes every thing down and wastes lot of time
4248,poor,Thinks she is a princess but is really just a boring prof.  I don't recommend her class.
2324,good,Good lecturer. Bird course~~
2709,average,Not the worst prof on the psl302 teaching team but certainly leaves more to be desired.  You either love or hate his monotonous teaching style.  Tests not hard if you do past tests and use his lecture notes - all answers to tests are directly taken off his slides.
3652,good,"lectures are quite boring. exams arent too bad. have to study alot, some questions come from self quizzes in book, online quizzes, old exams. overall real sweet lady, good prof. and i would recommend."
4015,poor,"I think posters here need to understand that Mike Lyons does not run the security program at GMU. The security program comprises many adjuncts and one other full-time professor,and he is now running parts of the program, and is very different (in a good way) from prof. Lyons.  Look for  bright spots in the program and make the best of it."
1989,good,"She is a wonderful professor. She provides the notes for you prior to the semester, and she is great at teaching. She always gives interesting visuals during class, and offers alot of extra credit opportunities! Loved her and her class!"
3686,good,Nicest lady. Makes BIO 104 as painless as possible for non-majors. You still have to study like a madman though.
2362,good,Hardest test I have ever given in my entire life. Lectures are simple but test questions are next level hard. Lectures are clear and easy to understand but lecture slides are very unhelpful. 
1975,good,You know the famous sex doctor Dr. Ruth&#63; enough said. Judy could be her sister or partner in crime.
1761,good,He's a pretty funny dude in class but don't expect to learn anything....better get the book if you wanna do well....
3391,good,"Great person, not a great teacher.  Smart woman but does not know how to teach what she knows."
1305,good,"If you go to class and do the readings its an easy a! shes a really good professor, really clear.  going to class is important though because she doesn't post lectures online and sometimes theres quizzes. Overall its a great psych class.. do the extra credit! i got a 54 on one of her tests and still managed to get an a for the semester!"
2739,poor,He made the course material about as interesting as watching paint dry.
1541,poor,just god poor
4101,poor,"This guy is a S of a B or (SOB) if you know what I mean.  HOLY CRAP!  He thinks he can bend space, he think the universe revolves around him!  He thinks that he can write his own god damn formatting and call it MLA or APA.  This guy needs to either get FIRED or deported back to Australia"
2472,good,"great prof! Clear, concise, always willing to answer questions, and therefore very helpful.  Is enthusiastic about chm.  Best prof ever!"
2642,good,"I found attending tutorial and keeping on top of problems/studying important.  She did have a tendency to read slides, but she was also easy to talk to, encouraged discussion, and was generally fair and pleasant."
2795,good,"I don't see what the problem is.  I did STA257/347 and now 447 with him and liked his style in every class.  Sure he's not the most accomodating of people when it comes to answering stupid questions, but after 30 years of teaching, thats understandable.  If you make an effor, you can do very well and learn a lot.  I got 90%+ in all three courses."
622,poor,"Growing up I loved King Arthur and Vikings.  Took this class and I have grown to hate it.  Don't take this class with a full (12cr+) load.  The readings are too much.  I think he spent more time telling us TO study than actually telling us WHAT to study.  He's a great guy, but Brit Lit shouldn't be this hard.  I smoked COMP I & II but dropped this."
3630,good,take her...she is good...she knows her material and she is so pationate about it...she is very animated which kinda helps keep ya awake too...its not an easy A by any means...but very doable!
1493,poor,"He is an poor teacher, going to class is pretty much pointless because you come out knowing absolutely NOTHING!  Class would be semi easy if you have a good teacher but wth him getting an A is very hard."
110,good,Baller.
2275,good,"Really opened my eyes. The material covered is excellent ! I sometimes feel that the lectures do not add so much to the material in the book. Very good lecturer, good sense of humour. Very happy I took this course."
3557,good,"Sweetest teacher ever. She was so helpful during office hours. No need for the textbook bc her powerpoints were word for word from the textbook. Hard class but if you put the effort in, you will do fine. You can tell that she loves her job which motivated me to do well. Take her!"
1169,good,"Phillis is the most amazing professor ever, i started with him first semester freshman year in bio, and he's perfect for getting bio majors enthused about the subject, definitely sparked my interest, you definitely need to think!"
3865,good,"There's 2 tests and a 3 week group project you can only work on in class. She's not into regurgitated answers, you have to think and make connections with the material for tests. She gives pop quizzes, half credit for being there and half for answering one super easy question. Basically free grade if you read, longest we read was 12 pages."
232,poor,"His power points are 200 slides per topic!!! He is not good at teaching a 100 level class. Exams are difficult, tricky questions. He does not curve."
66,good,Simply the best teacher of Introductory Computer Science Course at Stanford. Great Guy
1603,average,No Comments
2072,good,"Easy class, easy tests, all notes are in the simple packets that are handed out"
3283,poor,Please stay away from this teacher! She is absolutely the worst professor I have had in my entire life! I hope she gets fired because she is a huge liability to the Mason Accounting Dept. You will not learn anything in class as she does not know anything. The most unfair grader ever. Do NOT sign up for her under ANY cirumstances!!!
2192,good,first rate
536,good,"she was the worst teacher i have had at depaul, im a senior so i think thats saying a lot.  her class is extreemly easy but she is so boring.  ill tell u that the hour u r with her goes by slower than any class.  she takes it to serious and is not fun."
2859,good,Great Prof knows how to give insights on the knowledge and life
125,good,Great instructor.  He covers everything you need to succeed in his class (even stuff you should already know).  He keeps lectures interesting and encourages student participation without being condescending.  He uses notes sets that are very concise and his test questions come straight from them so no surprises and makes challenging material easier
2133,good,"Lectures proved long and difficult to engage with as the course progressed. States concepts with clearity and straight forward examples. His respect for students and acceptance to critisism is questionable. He will ask things from lectures on exams...otherwize, lectures are not critical for success."
1254,good,"Favorite teacher I've had at Umass. It is very clear what is expected of you. Light work load, but you will take a lot out of this class. Interesting concepts combined with an engaging and humorous teacher. Exams are easy, just do the review packets (which are basically identical to your notes) and you're all set. Drops grades, extra credit, easy. "
3905,good,"She knows a lot about the history of architecture, and she can also explain engineering. Never a dull moment in her class!"
1976,good,one of the easiest classes at umass. she spoon feeds you but you have to apply the info for the test. i didnt have the book. buy the packet of notes and study them and you should do fine. my average was a 99 and i hate sciences. theres homework now but they are interesting. great class
3866,good,"TESTS ARE HARD.  she is a tough grader. dont take her if you are not willing to work hard study a lot. for a 101 class there is A LOT of material. i regret taking her. although i have to admit, she made class fun and interesting. but to be honest. she takes the subject too seriously. not all students are going to be as attached to the topic as her"
3647,good,"Lively woman who teaches a quite interesting lecture. The class itself is the hard part, not her teaching. Shes fair on grading tests, you just have to study old tests and youll do fine."
2075,good,No Comments
484,good,"A true, genuine professor who yearns to inspire you, as long as, you're willing to be mentally challenged and learn more about yourself and other cultures. If not, your grade will definitely reflect it."
1654,poor,"With respect to humanity, Cook is an extremely pleasant and grandpa-esque little man. I did enjoy his anecdotes and his comments. What I didn't enjoy, however, was his poor teaching. This class stressed me out beyond belief because I hadn't the slightest clue of what was going on. Avoid him if you can."
1215,good,"very engaging for a large lecture, not as helpful one-on-one"
3086,good,"21-127 is probably the first formal math class for students in CMU. It's definitely hard, because college math is of course harder than high school math. Flaherty is a very interesting professor, and I really enjoy his teaching!"
3558,good,Read the book. Study the powerpoint slides--they paraphrase what the book says. Tests are based directly on the book and powerpoints. Not a hard class if you put in the necessary effort. Recording her lectures also really helped me--something you might want to consider. She's very knowledgeable and gives very great lectures.I highly recommend her.
3926,good,"I have taken 3 classes with Professor Bauman starting with ArtH 102, then 340 then 342. She inspired me to get a minor in art history. Her lectures are amazing and keep you on the edge of your seat always wanting to know more. Her tests do require a fair amount of studying - but hey, it's college! YOU MUST TAKE A CLASS WITH HER BEFORE YOU GRADUATE!"
3595,good,"She is a wonderful teacher. The first year I failed her class because I never went. If you go to class you will get an A! She has her ppt lectures online which is all you need. Even though she talks with her hands and makes is crystal clear, I did sometimes find myself falling asleep. Her final is just all her previous tests so get the answer keys!"
3345,good,Very helpful and make sure that students understand hard concept.Very knowlegeable best accounting information system teacher!!!! I enjoy this class!!!! Hilton is #1!!!take her and register early if you can.
3779,good,"She is UNBELIEVABLE! I dreaded having to take EVPP, but she is SO cool, especially once she knows who you are. She is very generous with extra credit too, and you can tell she truly wants her students to not only understand the material, but be successful in her class and enjoy it. She told a lot of interesting life stories too! LOVE HER!!!!"
1774,average,"Cool guy, but kind of monotone."
2410,good,Really really helpful :)
2797,good,He is the best and the smartest professor of the dept. of statistics. He loves his subject and certainly appreciates those who share that love with him.
918,good,"Professor Christopher is by far, one of the best professors on campus."
1646,good,Great teacher. first time I have taken clac in a year and I still managed to get a B/B+ easily (forgot calculator for one exam set me below an A = my fault). He can explain where every equation originates from. VERY HELPFUL. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1026,good,"good guy. Hard exams, but worth it. Also if you go to the last class, you'll get a full overview of the whole class in about 20 seconds."
1030,good,"This was an entirely project-based class and had three intensive team projects. They were stressful and a lot of work, but Randy recognizes that and is always there to help us out. We have still not gotten the first projects back and I have little doubt he will grade all three of them. I learned a lot of scientific skills and loved this class."
882,good,hes the man kids
1335,good,"good teacher. makes the material interesting, gives lots of opportunities to get a good grade. there is a lot of homework (readings, quizzes) but its not excessive if you do the work when its meant to be due. attendance is not required but if you miss a day of notes, you will be missing a lot of information for the exam."
2746,poor,No Comments
3490,good,"You have to participate in this class. The material's clear cut, but you won't get as much of an understanding reading as listening to Fondufe talk. Her lectures, though, make it not a chore at all."
2713,poor,"He was impossible to listen to during lectures!  Too monotone... does not show any enthusism and with such difficult material as PSL302, we NEED some enthusiasm!"
364,good,"You know, I liked him personally because he is friendly but really did not care for his wanna be rock star image, sideburns and political garbage. The class was okay, he is smart and like I said, always friendly."
4260,good,"One of my favorite professors at Mason. Organizes the class very well. Make sure you go to her lecture because she puts material from lecture on exams because she knows a lot of people do not go to lecture. If you get the chance, take her!"
3287,poor,"It is absolutely useless to ask her questions. She will literally laugh at you if she's convinced you will fail, she will call you names in the most derogatory manner, and she will simply tell you to &quot;Do It All Over Again&quot; because she simply does not understand the material enough for any constructive advice. For your sake, DO NOT TAKE HER!!!"
2125,good,theres obviously a reason why he's got the most people rating him. Great prof!!
27,poor,She was a terrible teacher. Her views are too left winged to be teaching at a majorly Conservative university. She grades extremely hard on papers and will not listen to your concerns...so if you have to take the class take it with anyone except her.  I have not had any problems with teachers before but this teacher was terrible.
473,average,"If you're not good with history, multiple-choice tests, fill-in, or short essay tests, this class isn't for you. His personality kind of annoys me. He can be funny at times. Although I studied hard for his tests, they were still difficult. He also makes you do a group video project throughout the semester. I dropped because I was failing."
525,good,"Interesting class, good teacher."
725,poor,No Comments
55,good,"Mehran Sahami, what Stanford is all about, great teaching, new ideas, helping you ask big questions and build good stuff."
638,poor,"Possibly one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He grades very harshly on your papers, he gives his students way to much work and his due date are way to close together to actually try and figureout/understand what you've messed up on. His death by power point is useless and not helpful at all."
302,average,"The best way to succeed in this class is to actually go to class and pay attention.  However, this is hard because he does not stay on topic and he throws so much info at you it is hard to know what will even be on the tests. But he has a great grade scale so go to all labs and turn in all homework and you will do good."
2766,poor,No Comments
4104,poor,Still doing damage in IT department......
1276,good,"Tammy is an good lecturer, her classes are always fun and interactive. She is very clear about what you need to know on exams. The exams are very thorough, but are based on her lecture slides and all other book vocab. She drops the lowest exam, no mandatory final. Go to class, read the book, and do the study guides to get an A."
1890,good,amazing and fun
624,poor,"I'm taking his class online and his syllabus is extremely confusing and hard on the eyes. I have a hard time reading this that are bold and brightly colored, and his syllabus frequently does this. When I ask him for clarification or assistance, he tells me I should have read or checked something. I love English, but this class made me feel stupid."
2055,good,"terrific professor! she is very clear, informative, and knows how to hold your interest. tests are very resonable."
1280,good,"Such a great teacher; very interesting to listen to, and very funny. Attendance isn't mandatory but there are some pop quizzes so try not to miss class. Also her lectures and notes are very helpful so if you go to class you don't have to read the textbook. Tests are not too hard but studying helps a lot. Would definitely take again."
2851,good,"Excellent professor.  Shut mouth, stop complaining, open ears, engage brain & you will most definitely learn something."
1049,average,"BioTAP 190H was a love-hate class. We had no book, and did 3 group projects. We learned to read/analyze scientific writing and think like researchers. Group dynamics were HARD! Lab was also hard. The course is hard, and Randy takes this into consideration for grading. Randy was nice and helped me with my group problems. Only take if you love Bio!"
336,good,"Good professor! Knows how to keep a class interested. Yes, he's got crazy political views but he knows how to teach. He covers the genetics/evolution unit of the course, which will be more difficult than the ecology/conservation unit. So his tests might come across as a tad difficult. But overall, good professor."
47,good,He is simply great! ;)
2878,good,"He is a good professor, who made the material interesting and approachable. However the tests were about specific statistics, in specific years, and too much in depth to get the big picture of sociology.  Reading is a must!"
106,good,"take his class, enough said."
2397,good,"nice dude, but very hard. his tests seem to come out of nowhere!"
1079,good,"Randy's class is all about logic and interpreting diagrams. There is basically no memorizing. He rarely gives feedback on grades, especially on quizzes, but it makes you focus more on learning than on the grade. I learned how to think in this class instead of just being fed the material. Classes are very interactive. Overall, a good class."
2286,good,"Great sense of humour, interesting material, fair tests, approachable..."
2261,average,No Comments
1144,good,"If you're going to take Bio100, he's definitely the one to take it with. He's very enthusiastic and the class is extremely interactive (lots of PRS). He's one of the most dedicated professors I've had...has review sessions every Thursday (there's a quiz every Fri), plus before all exams. He's very fair and understanding as well."
3751,good,"Largen is SUPER nice and funny if you really listen to her. The lecture is easy (mostly stuff you already learned in high school) and the tests aren't bad either. The lab SUCKS though. The lab and lecture did not line up at all and my TA graded unreasonably hard! Largen is good, but 30% of your grade comes from the lab..."
2296,good,A+
2841,average,easy to get good marks in supposedly the hardest 2nd year stats course- what else could you want&#63;&#63; very easy prof!
3144,poor,"worst teacher ever. i had to teach myself everything, and even then i did horrible on his tests. his tests only cover like 2% of the material he expects us to know for the exam. also, he is really boring."
1836,good,"I think she is a good professor. The book costs $160, only available at the campus textbook store.  You have to buy her powerpoint notes for $35 too.  Way too much monotonous work for a 100 level class.  If you're like me, and you want to go this 9AM once a week, not do all the work and just get a C+ type of grade, this isn't a good 100 class."
1753,good,very easy class. No real homework. Allows you to use a notecard on the exam. Can be funny at times
1101,good,"good! Had a sense of humor that kept most interested.  Can be confusing at times and to do well i suggest taking notes from what he says.  He assigns readings from the text book but i didnt find them necessary. it definately helped that i had some background in bio, but overall i think randy was great."
1968,good,Professor Goodenough is super helpful and is a great teacher. She makes class very interesting by relating it to sex and her family. I would recommend her any day of the week. I actually look forward to her class.
3564,average,Had her for lab. She gives us so much work. UNNECESSARY WORK. AVOID FOR LAB AT ALL COSTS.
3117,poor,"worst teacher i have ever had, excited about math, but not about teaching"
2393,good,those term tests are pure evil !!! but the exams are pretty fair. The prof himself is a very  approachable n helpful prof.
523,good,"Pretty cool guy...when I had him, he gave a lot of chances for extra credit...Big time points. Very easy to get a good grade in his class...that's my opinion."
2280,average,I have not been class in months becuase I fall asleep to the sound of that man's voice.....thank god his tests are so easy and there are summaries available online for his text book.
2692,poor,"After having taught this course for years and having heard numerous times the criticism about speaking up in class so students can hear him and laying down the foundations before jumping to complexities, he still doesn't attempt to improve his lecturing style. If hundreds of students complain each year, think it's time for improvements."
2885,poor,"His tests are REALLY tough and tricky. He makes those options look very similar so you have to pay really close attention to the textbook and lecture slides to memorize EVERYTHING. Jesus.. Don't you know that we have another four or five courses to study? Well,  do not recommend him especially to those who just hate multiple choices questions"
1428,good,"One of the best professors there is! interesting lectures. Rahhal is funny, gives great examples, makes subject matter easy to understand. Two thumbs up for her!"
2581,poor,one word.. Boring... most pathetic prof at u of t. has no interaction... students sit in class and fall asleep in front of her. exams are average difficulty. but this prof is litrally of no use watsoever
681,good,"Professor Sacher is SUCH a little sweetheart! I really had no idea what I was going into when I registered for this class, but I am SO happy I did! Class is just one big discussion and she is So understanding and HYSTERICAL. 1 written assignment in lieu of a midterm & a log due each week, but it only has to be 1 page. Highly recommended!! :)"
603,good,"3 essays, 1 research paper, 3 exams. You have to do the readings (or read the cliff notes at least) to pass his quizzes. I didn't mind typing the papers, what got me was trying to get him to approve my thesis so I could type the paper. So glad I never have to hear ""Ok this is great, BUT....."" again. He does provide feedback and offers office hours"
1489,poor,his is not a good teacher at all. his lectures do not help to understand the material. i teach my self every night with the homework examples.
3685,good,makes bio very easy to understand! I dont understand how anyone could fail this class! super teacher! very nice!
4251,good,This class is not that bad. I got a D on the 1st test D on the 2nd test and a C on the final and still passed with a B. I never really studied. The lab quizzes and homeworks really helped! If you actually read the material (unlike myself) you can get an A!!
3122,poor,"gives replacement exams that could hurt your grade. condecending during office hours. if the class average on a test is hoovering around 50%, you know something is wrong"
3834,average,soo boring - she reads right from the notes- they're online- so no need to go
60,good,"Great teacher, thanks to whom I fell in love with coding and computers again. Very well presented, with plenty of real life abstraction, humour and language that even non-tech students will understand. Great job - if there would be more teachers like Mr. Sahami, world would be much nicer place..."
1969,good,I had Prof Goodenough for a few classes and she is the best professor at UMass. Hands down. She is so cute! So so so helpful and truly wants you to do well. Gives so much extra credit and chances to boost your grade. Definitely take her if you have the chance!
671,good,"I've been speaking English all my life, but I finally understand all the rules for English very clearly. He is more than willing to fully explain things that you may not understand. If you don't pass this class you are not trying."
92,good,very good.....teacher..i hv ever seen........
666,good,a very professional instructor and he means business so if you are looking for easy a this aint where youll find it
3544,average,"I would avoid Dr. Fondufe if possible. She just reads straight off the powerpoint slides. The class is not intellectually stimulating. Exams are ridiculously hard, even if you study. Ppt slides are straight out of the book, so the fact that I got this expensive book was stupid. Doesn't tell you when some assignments are due (not on BB OR syllabus)."
1887,poor,"This professor was good when I had her for Psych 100, but don't ever do an Honors Thesis with her.  Unless you are in her Departmental Honors program she won't even give you the time of day and doesn't take you seriously.  She's good as a lecturer, but horrible as a mentor."
3266,poor,"RUN.  Run far, far away from her. She does not explain a thing. she only says ?this is years of experiences?"
280,good,He's is such an good guy! Really interesting lecturer and really funny too. I highly recommend taking homeostasis with him!
1719,poor,"He is a nice guy, but does not know how to teach at all!  Only take this class if you're comfortable with teaching yourself the material."
3573,good,"Absolutely amazing. She's very difficult, but also very helpful and will help you outside of class as well. She's good and I would definitely recommend her!!"
359,average,"Interesting lecturer but DIFFICULT detailed tests. I hear he used to be a fairly easy teacher then read his ratings and decided to toughen up... all of us got the 'new' Molumby... :( Also, Murray's tests are much easier!"
899,good,She is very passinate and honest. I loved taking her and hope to take her again. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was having to buy her book. You can't rent it because the worksheets in them are tunred in (which she grades harshly).Take notes because they will help on your tests. Show up to class because she may give extra credit. She's funny too
1935,good,No Comments
4268,good,Good class Good professor
1994,good,Judy is the best. Shes tells wicked lame but funny jokes :) You dont need to buy the text book. Just print out the notes and look at them and you'll do fine. She always changes how she grades but its wicked easy and she offers a ton of extra credit. She wicked helpful and understanding. love her!
3628,poor,"I found her lectures hard to follow and waaaay to fast to soak up any information. I fell asleep most classes, but still got an A pretty easily by studying the text book. Going to class is barely necessary with posted ppts and the text."
2895,average,Half year course. two midterms worth 25% each an final worth 50%. Very picky with little facts and pointless statistics; general ideas or theories were rarely tested on. definitely would not recommend this course. Everyone left the lecture in a bad mood when he was in one (even in con hall). often messes up answers on tests and exams.
3254,poor,"Read the textbook and go to the lab.Do that and you will have at least a B. Hylton and her lectures are...worthless. The TAs will do all the teaching. She is also extremely rude, she insults students rather than helps them. I had to resist the daily urge to smack her. She must be hitting 24/7 periods and lapping it all up."
760,poor,Hard teacher. Blame the department for the hard tests but practice tests are nothing like the real ones. Class is so boring i've might lost attention numerous times every class. Nothing came clear to me any classes. AVOID HIM
2158,good,"amazing prof! very interesting,very clear! if you're taking sociology at UofT, make sure it's with him!"
1906,good,She is a great teacher. Good teaching style and makes the class worth while and fun. Take this class you will learn a lot and have fun!
42,good,I liked him.
2173,good,"I came into the class with high expectations and I did not leave disappointed! Professor Brym is one of the most articulate, intelligent and helpful professors out there and he has always delivered his lectures with passion, interest and just a simple love for job. This course was a great experience and I recommenend it to all first-years."
204,average,"Not your typical professor. He knows what hes talking about however. If I was to retake the course, I would read the lecture slides and make sure I understand all of the terms since he goes over many examples during lecture. You'll get lost if you don't remember what something means. His tests are tricky. You have to be focused for them. fair Curve"
1473,good,"Prof. Rudvalis is a good guy. He'll help you out if you nicely approach him. The class is a bit boring, but what do you expect from material you did back in middle school&#63;"
2100,poor,He's knowledgable about the topic but can be very rude when answering questions. The data he uses are all outdated and the tests are brutal since it asks about the tiny statistical details. Not approachable at all
2593,average,She is terrible! She has to go teach in a basement somewhere. NOT IN AN UNIVERSITY!!!
68,good,"Mehran is honestly one of the best professors I from whom I have had the privilege to learn. He's very clear, and incorporates humor into his lesson. A huge chunk of material which may be confusing is cleared up after attending a lectures. He proactively asks for relevant questions and answers them meaningfully."
4238,good,"She's very clear in her lectures and emphasizes important things. Very organized class, exams were hard, make sure you take full advantage of good grades in lab."
1875,good,"Professor Whitbourne provides an easy intro class that is good for anyone to take.  3 exams, weekly discussions, which you can do online, online homework for each class, extra credit available."
2832,poor,The worst prof
3737,good,"Ms. Largen is a very sweet and helpful lady. Yes, her class is not the most academic an is basically a conglomeration of biology and chemistry concepts and factoids, but for a non-science major, that's what you're looking for anyway."
3472,average,"So not being a biology major or someone who knows very little about biology should not take this class. She claimed that she wasn't going to go into too much detail since 99% of the students weren't biology majors, but that was not true. Her tests were extremely hard and your grade is based off of 3 tests and online homework. Not a fan."
2231,poor,it's not really sociology than philosophy of prof. brym.  a very boring lecturer who basically repeats most of what is already in the readings without much clarification. he also wrote the text which is extremely long winded and unnecessary.
137,poor,He needs to act a little more professional and quite acting like a immature college punk!!
2947,average,"Don't Take this Class, unless u enjoy reading and have a lot of time in your hand."
796,poor,This man is a horrible professer.  He is useless when it coems to extra help or getting questions answered and he is horrendous at teaching.  Might as well not even attend class. Waste of time.
2180,good,"-doesn't stutter in his lectures, they're well rehearsed, very interactive with the class"
2128,good,"EXCELLENT PROFESSOR. MADE ME FALL IN LOVE WITH SOCIOLOGY. HE IS EXTREMELY SERIOUS, AND MIGHT SEEM UNAPPROACHABLE HOWEVER, HE IS REALLY NICE. HIS BOOKS ARE AMAZING, HE IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT PERSON I HAVE COME ACROSS. BY THE WAY, FOR THE PEOPLE THINKING OF TAKING SOC101 (THINKING THAT IT WILL BE EASY) YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN!!:)"
3177,poor,"Completely all over the place ZERO organization/communication skills. Reviews are useless. Spends all period on 1 ch gets very frustrated along the way, by the time she gets to ch 2 class is over and she's just giving out hw answers. NO grading criteria AT ALL. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! The worst professor I've ever dealt with in many aspects"
758,good,Great teacher. first time I have taken clac in a year and I still managed to get a B/B+ easily (forgot calculator for one exam set me below an A = my fault). He can explain where every equation originates from. VERY HELPFUL. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
541,poor,the worst teacher i've had at depaul.
1019,poor,"good guy, but not a great professor. Never got anything out of his lectures. Doesn't email back, lucky for him he had some good TA's helping him out. Teaches a 300+ student class as if there were only 15 students there. Reason I changed majors. Need good notes and studying a lot from alternative sources than himself. Everything is TF."
3591,good,"She is the most straight forward and organized teacher I've had at gmu! Quizzes are easy, tests are reasonable. You do not need to buy the textbook at all, everything is from ppts and no more iclicker. Study the powerpoint and you can probably get an A on the exams. People complain about her accent but its pretty comprehensible. Lecture unecessary."
3031,poor,"This prof. and the course sucks. Listen DO NOT TAKE IT. He claims to make 'easy' exams, but they are not really. Needs to be improved a lot."
3552,good,She is extremely helpful. Love her energy and her study guides a must do in order to do good on the test. Don't buy the book.
165,poor,Don't even bother. Worst professor ever.
248,poor,"Molumby is very non-traditional with his teaching methods to say the least. Average professor and the class was an easy A. Just ignore all his ridiculous yet hilarious comments about evolution and you should be fine. Oh yeah, and get a good TA. They matter big time. Class doesn't require studying."
1331,good,"Excellent! She is very nice and energetic about what she is teaching and is very funny. She makes class interesting, and it's very important to attend class because not all the notes are online. She tells you exactly what will be on the exam and makes it very easy for you to get an A if you're willing to put in the work. Definitely take her class!"
2017,good,"it's phenomenal, which i don't think jude was. Her class was easy, I just felt bad because it was soo boring and people either didn't come or left early. Tons of extra credit though, just not the most interesting material ever."
446,poor,He is a horrible professor. His presentations did not help me prepare for any of test. attendance is mandatory but i did not see the point of going to his class because the test is made up of everything that's in the book. I do not recommend anyone taking his class.
2482,good,"One of the best profs around, he makes chemistry interesting and lectures worth attending... oh yeah, and did i mention he's hot&#63;!&#63; ;)"
2906,poor,Too hard! Too scattered! Too much readings! Too detailed tests!
1358,good,"Best Class I've taken yet, actually looked forward to her lectures, gives lots of extra credit got a B in the class and never got over a c+ on any exam, highly recommanded"
2845,good,Geez..stop complaining (students below). This prof. is actually very good. He explains concepts really well. His tests are pretty fair. It is possible to get a very high mark in the class (providing you have a good memory). What more could you want&#63;
2145,poor,Bad.
1329,good,"good CLASS! im taking this class at 9 am and i actually look forward to it. it's an easy A if you go to class.. & you do have to read a little, but it's interesting! she's hilarious and keeps things entertaining. take this class!"
2853,average,No Comments
2785,poor,"Uses his own derivations, his own proofs, his own notation which are NOT to be found in ""standard"" or ""accessible"" textbooks.  His questions are super difficult. He requires proofs to be done HIS way. The material itself is hard as hell. Should be avoided at all costs. Poor lecture notes (chicken scrap), and gets angry and rude very quickly. AVOID!"
763,average,"Confused why everyone is talking about how he makes exams hard.. he doesn't even write the exams, the department does. He even admitted he thought the exam was too hard so he would scale the final grades for our class. caring and knows his stuff, calc can be confusing, not his fault. I skip class at least 2 out of 3 times a week, still manage an A."
3493,good,"Good professor, energetic and enjoys the content she is teaching. Makes things very clear in her powerpoints. Sometimes I lose interest in class, but only because it is a big lecture hall. Tests are moderately hard but not if you study"
2150,good,"Brym is a great prof. He's very organized, clear and articulate. Overall a good learning experience. However, I seriously think the prof should reassess his evaluation methods. Sometimes his MC tests were too hard, asking specific percentage changes etc. Dont take his class if you plan to get a high grade without putting &quot;A LOT&quot; of effort."
434,good,"William Seigh is one of the greatest teachers i've ever had, In and out of the classroom. Not only did he spark my interest in dance, but he's helped form an entirely new perspective on the world. William is a compassionate, fun, charismatic man who is a joy to learn from and talk to. If you can take a class with him I highly recommend it"
2122,good,"Although his lecture are quite redundant at times, he's a good teacher. His tests revolve around definitions to the textbook to which he is the author, so if you read the textbook, you'll do well. Never have I gone to ask him for help, and thats because everything is so clear that I was rarely ever confused of the class content! Great Proff."
577,poor,No Comments
2900,good,Very fun professor to work with. Draws up funny and clear anologies during his class to make sense to the student.It seems that alot of negative feedback is given from 1st year students in the huge classes but in the smaller more interactive classes(such as mine) people enjoy the classes immensely. I will definitely take another class with him
3758,average,"Professor Largen is very nice. However the class is useless ESPECIALLY if you're just looking to fufill the science gen ed. THE CLASS IS TOO MUCH WORK FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH! There are iclickers (a lot), lab quizzes, lab report, excursions outside, hw, ppt project, and ridiculous lab work! Everyone says this class is so easy but it's just so much work"
3278,poor,"This woman is the rudest, most insane woman I've even encountered as a professor. She screams at you if you ask for help. Do Not EVER take her class."
2966,good,He's easy going and pretty funny... but he always thinks HE is right (of course)
3374,poor,"Terrible! She doesn't know how to explain nor can she tell how does she get the answers. Everything she says/does is an exact copy of the book. If she graded you wrong, when you went up to her, she would say half of what you are supposed to get or nothing. What a terrible teacher."
2814,poor,Worst prof I've had as an undergrad.
4213,poor,Tests are very hard. The class was also extremely boring with useless info. I'm glad my major is finance instead of management
2448,good,great
1848,good,She's good
762,good,This guy is really helpful if you go to his office hours. His door is always open for people who want to learn. He is a great teacher
3037,poor,Notes are terrible
388,good,Great Profesor. Easy Class.  Same tests as before.  Very interest random rants.  DEFN TAKE HIM.
235,poor,"worst professor ever. not only does he refuse to use the mic, he always mumble useless information. along with that, he mentions certain information during lecture (that is not on the ppt or on the book) and puts it as a question on the exam. BUT ITS USELESS BECAUSE YOU CANT EVEN HEAR HIM. refuses to give a curve when he fails to project his voice."
1077,good,"Genuinely wants to help people learn but not clear on answers and scatterbrained explaining things. Uses PRS to track attendance. Extremely late on grading, does not hand back tests. Almost no assigned homework."
1984,good,Judy is a absolutely adorable woman.  Definitely take her class! She does not take attendence but class is enjoyable and I did not mind sitting through it.  She is funny and interesting and the tests are straight forward.  She wrote the book so if you read it you're fine. Take her!
267,good,He is a good lecturer but gets off point at times. His tests are SUPER hard because of the amount of detail that are in them.
3377,average,Doesn't give +/-'s which I thought really sucked. I only went to lecture when there was a quiz in lab the next day or for exams and then for exam review. Lectures were pretty boring. Did not like the class one bit. Too bad you have to take her.
770,average,"He knows the material, he just teaches it different then the other teachers.  If you took calc in high school, you'll be fine.  and if not, just go to a different lecture.  he does help with some things and you can always ask him for extra help.  fairly easy class overall"
2165,good,Good Prof
437,good,No Comments
673,good,"Maybe English just comes easier to me than others, but I thought this class was cake. Fork and iceing, it was all cake. I wish every class was this easy!"
249,good,This class was ridiculously easy! Did not look at a SINGLE powerpoint slide. Did not TOUCH the book. Just simply studied previous exams and got an A. Attended lecture only to get iclicker points then stopped going.
2201,poor,No Comments
1574,poor,No Comments
3143,poor,"Do yourself a favor... Don't take Calculus in 3-D with him. Based on the FCEs, it seems like he's pretty good for Set Theorty, but who takes that&#63;!"
2142,good,"Attending lectures and reading all the assigned chapters is crucial. He likes to ask random, small details that can be easily overlooked so read everything with high understanding. His tests are harder than the subject material demands. Many questions tend to be &quot;trick&quot; questions. Overall, it's a difficult intro course & Brym is strict & uptight!"
3419,poor,"Horrible person but not a bad teacher.  She's scary and is crazy, she'll chase students if they leave class early and randomly calls on students in a huge lecture class and takes points off if you don't have your book."
2081,good,"easy class, memorize the notes she gives you and you'll get an A"
1823,good,"3 multiple choice tests, 6 in-class assignments (attendance), SPARK quiz every class thats ridiculously easy and an optional final.  Class can be interesting at times.  Go for the review points, that is all that's on the test.  There is an optional discussion for extra credit, but it isn't necessary unless you are going to slack off.  Easy."
4053,average,"I am a program manager at a major defence contractor, who shall remain nameless. I had the pleasure of talking with  E.V. at lunch one day about the future of education and my experience with Michael Lyons. Thats all I wanted to say. Have a great day everybody!"
880,good,"lively class, explains the materials well."
448,good,"He's an amazing professor. Extremely funny and won't fail to make you laugh every class. Exams are only difficult if you do not study or go to class. The actual course and the material is difficult, but not how he teaches. Extremely NOT okay with using electronics in class."
1469,poor,"Absolutely horrendous. The guy comes, talks, and leaves. Writes down whole paragraphs explaining the stuff. A human being could not possibly be any drier in presenting fairly simple material. The stuff is easy, but the exams are ridiculous. I did fine on all the homeworks, but bombed the exams. Unless you're a natural at math, AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
716,good,AWSOME! extremely helpful and fun class! She is an awsome professor who actually makes learning fun and easy.  DO TAKE!!!
4108,poor,Take the advice people have given here. I only took him because there was no other option. He is very unhelpful and  impatient. He really does not show any interest into seeing that his students pass his class. DO NOT TAKE HIM!
50,good,One of  the most impressive lecture at Stanford.  Well-organized lecture and tough course work (programming assignment.) Essential for CS student. 
2048,good,"I liked her a lot, but those exams were tricky I thought.  Lectures are boring, except for when she makes her jokes, which were great.  Packets are key, they make class less mandatory."
1901,average,"this was one of the worst classes i have ever taken. i took this class as a sr as an elective. this class was full of mindless homework assignments which was just &quot;busy&quot; work. it had the structure of a middle school class. i learned nothing about psych, just about old people in society. a bigwaste"
3929,good,"So .. she's literally one of the best professors I've ever had.  I was having some grade issues and she helped me personally to get them back up.  I've never had another professor take such an individual interest in student.  Having said that, her class is difficult.  You really need to study.  But she is fantastic. I strongly recommend her."
3149,poor,No Comments
3156,average,"The subject in itself is difficult, so having her teach you does you know benefit whatsoever. Don't let her scare you because she will help you sometimes if you ask her one on one. Overall this course pushes you because you practically teach yourself everything. I advise you to grab a friend from class and learn from each other. Overall not poor!"
1168,good,"Phillis is an OK teacher.  He's very enthusiastic and social which is cool, but tends to be condescending and arrogant.  He teaches in a very whishy washy manner, he kind of teaches around the subject, instead of getting to the point.  Class might be difficult if you do not have a biology background"
82,good,Mr Mehran is simply a brilliant teacher.
3529,good,"This course was extremely easy with her. All you have to do is show up to class and PAY ATTENTION to the slides. They are what she bases her exams off of. For the final, study your previous 3 exams and you should be fine. Very Easy to get a very good grade in this course B+ to an A."
3805,average,This class is the most ridiculous class ever. Largen spends entirely too much time rambling and wastes half the class away before actually reaching the course material. AVOID.
2724,poor,"His lectures aren't bad. However, his tests are a different story. My god, I can't believe I spent 5 sleepless nights to study for that. Tests are unfair and does not test you with the knowledge he gives in class. At this rate, he's gonna have to bell curve."
3870,good,Simply good. Really enjoyed attending all her lectures. Super personable and engaging especially for a morning class.  Gives out study guides before the exams that are very helpful! Recommend textbook to pass. 
3044,poor,You can never feel comfortable to ask questions in his class or else he will tend to make you look bad or say something sarcastic 
3094,good,Oh and his corny jokes make me crack up each time. Easily the best math professor I've ever had. The final is optional!
1460,poor,terrible teacher. get out of his class right now. he does not care about any of his students.
2818,good,"That guy is very strange to get along with.  Try asking a stupid question, and he will make the entire class laugh at you!  He likes &quot;smart&quot; students and &quot;smart&quot; question.  If you get on his bad side, or talking while he is talking, he will kick you out of the lecture hall, no kidding!  If you tolerat his persona, you can get your A."
1893,poor,"GOOD: tries to make class interesting/relevant w/ videos/music/quotes, makes jokes, involves students, generally helpful and an intelligent lady. BAD: most of her jokes/tangents are only funny to her, talks about herself a lot, relies on TAs too much, and there is SOOOOOOO MUCH busywork. Ok gen. ed."
1668,average,"Really nice guy, easy to talk to to, willing to help, but he can't teach. If you have never taken calc then DO NOT take it with him. You will have no idea what he is talking about."
2756,good,Most difficult material in undergrad lifesci. He did as well as anyone could
2000,good,"Amazing professor, makes class so much fun"
475,good,"the best teacher I've had for any science ever!!! he was my favorite teacher freshman year, i am def taking cultural anthropology with him next year"
517,good,Me again :) Films are really interesting (yes...i had to add that)
4091,average,"PROFESSOR SNAPE!!!  He really has no redeemable social qualities that would aid in the student-professor relationship.  He has exactly 0 personality.  The smile in the photo here might be the only one you ever see.  His tests aren't easy, not terribly hard either and he is decently smart.  Obviously, I wouldn't recommend him."
404,good,"Great teacher...somewhat difficult class.  But overall, great class."
384,good,This semester he has changed.  He DOESN'T use the old questions from old exams.  SO basically the people who studied only old exams got screwed.  His genetics test was really hard and he even admitted that.  You basically need to read the chaptres and memorize captions and detailed information because anything is fair game for molumby's test.
3820,good,"Nice lady, probably the easiest science gen-ed but too much contrast between ridiculously easy middle school science and then rushing through the stuff that's actually complicated."
3877,good,"Prof Bauman is really nice and funny. She cracks jokes all the time, and tries to make class fun. Her 1st exam is easy just take notes and follow the study guide. I would go through the study guide and write out answers for each section before exams. She gives extra credit for each exam so take advantage She takes surprise attendance so go to class"
2152,good,"He's a great prof who can gets his point across to you clearly, although I would say some of the question he ask on the test is a bit too detail which I find it difficult (such as asking for number of years and number of %)"
1633,good,Prof Cook is an excellent man. He is funny and really knows his stuff. He can explain any problem to you. He is enthusiastic about his teaching and wants you to understand. He is always in the lab if you need help. Would take him again as a professor.
4301,poor,"Eh, I mean I got in A in this class, but I never really paid attention in his class, and at times I skipped. The lectures were boring and useless, he gives out study guides on what will be on the quizzes and tests, but I found all of those answers in the textbook. He dropped the lowest quiz and test, but Idk if that was always the case before"
688,poor,"do not take her. yeah i agree with everyone saying that she is such a nice person. BUT!! her materials are so hard and we need to do our own research as a group meaning that we actaully have to do interview, naturalistic observation and survey!! Such a hard class and she is NOT an easy grader. This class is the worst class i've ever had at msu."
3835,good,Make sure you have her notes because 80-90% of the test are memorized notes.
2874,average,"He doesn't give any assignments or homework. There are 2 term tests during the course, and the questions are all multiple choices. You must do all the readings or you won't pass"
1240,good,"There's a reason she is being nominated for some teaching award this year. She is a super nice lady, not only helpful, but extremely funny. She keeps lectures very entertaining by connecting her own hilarious life stories to the content. She teaches the content pretty well overall. I highly recommend Tammy."
62,good,One of the greatest teachers for CS !
3353,poor,Not a good professor!  Very rude.  Does not respond to emails.  Avoid this professor!
852,average,"He is a really nice person, but his lectures are not helpful at all. in order to do good in his class u must teach it all to u'r self. even then his exams are rediculously difficult. he is out to get u on the exams. i would avoid him at all costs."
4217,good,"The topics in this class are interesting and related to some psychology.You have to read the book to understand all the topics covered in the lecture. This class is not hard as long as you put efforts, so efforts equal A."
3896,poor,"She takes Art 101 WAY TOO SERIOUSLY. For a gen ed, it's way too complicated. She has a PHD in Art so she likes to think everyone will be interested. If you have to study for Art 101  more than major core classes, there is something wrong. Alot of memorization, no multiple choice, no powerpoints, no Blackboard. You HAVE to be in class."
1262,good,Tammy is my favorite professor at UMass (and I'm now a senior). Her classes are always enjoyable and you will enjoy going to class.
223,poor,No curve and impossible tests. They don't accurately portray your knowledge of the material but rather your ability to decode his questions and figure out what he actually is trying to ask. Power points are 175 pages per topic. Most unhelpful professors I've encountered.
2193,good,"Great lecturer. Very clear, slow speaker, and easy to approach."
3136,poor,"Yeah, so I dropped this course after others did.He is completely unintelligible and unclear when he teaches. He teaches in such a vague manner and says stuff like &quot;you could try this..it's wrong, btw, but in a way its right..&quot; and rambles, he's not organized. He likes guests at office hour, but I just can't understand him."
373,good,one of my favorite professors
1824,poor,"Whitbourne is enthusiastic, but sometimes too much. Essays easy, just know the review points from every lecture. Multiple easy extra credits points. Definitely go to review sessions held by TAs. NEVER go to review sessions in class: she only reviews what you have to review. You ask her a question, she says go and review."
3996,good,Never had him before but had a good experience with his online 366 class. Managed to earn an A and my only advice is to answer every question in the midterm and final study guides and memorize them. That will guarantee you an A
3190,poor,"She shunned me the first day of class because she didn't know something and I clarified it for her, so yeah. yuck. If you get on her good side, you will love her. If you're like most people, you won't like her. Unfortunately she's not going anywhere, so you'll probably get stuck taking her. Invest in some upper-level accounting friends to help."
4305,good,"He has a great personality and is very experienced in his field.  He teaches using examples and his experience, which may not be what most students are looking for.  This class is an easy A if you do one thing: READ THE BOOK.  The lectures are primarily for clarification.  Testing is fair and easy; overall the course is nothing to stress over."
4253,poor,Class is easy but lots of stuff to read. exam is very hard. Very confuse class i have ever taken. If she can make the exam little easier it might helps all the student to pass the class. Since all of us not majoring on Mamagement. Very hard to remember all the stuff from the book. There should be easy way of understanding this book.
3322,poor,"Don't come to class late or leave early. Print the slides before class. Exams are fairly hard and you do need to study. TAs take attendance for lab, but its not a part of your grade so don't go unless it helps you. I never did the homework or went to lab, and I got an A. Just study hard and do whatever problems in the book that she recommends."
3313,good,"&quot;NO PAIN, NO GAIN!&quot; As cliche as it sounds, it is very true for Hylton. I guarantee if you do exercises after each lecture and read the chapters without procrastination, you will get a B. I also guarantee she will prepare you to the next accounting course better than any other prof. Don't be fooled by false comments. GOOD LUCK!"
797,average,"I thought he was funny and down to earth, he didnt have an ego like most proff.  He does make the class a bit tough though, still a good guy."
2871,poor,"Lectures are waste of time, easy course"
9,good,"Hora is an amazing teacher and does a lot to help you. if you put in the work, she will grade fairly"
2497,average,BAH HUMBUG
1944,good,"This is possibly the easiest course I have ever taken- not even because the material is easy, but because Judy does such a good job explaining it all. She is such a nice lady, and she finds ways to make material more interesting. There's only 4 tests, an optional final, and 1 homework per week. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BIO 106 TO EVERYONE.  "
1838,good,"she is wonderful, my first class in UMASS, got high hopes for the rest of my classes for my UMASS career. i hope she keeps teaching and all the students gets to experience this good class!"
708,good,"Sweetest lady ever. She kind of reminds me of Kitty from That 70's Show, but she is still an amazing professor. I wish she taught more classes instead of just Interpersonal Relations."
255,good,"Molumby is good! He is very helpful and straightforward. His test are difficult but if you study and read all of the information you should be fine!My favorite professor thus far! As far as hot, of course!"
2930,average,"When I visited my old high school early in first year, one of my former teachers had Tepperman when HE was at U of T - this guy has been around for a while.. Not a bad prof, but kind of greedy for making you buy three of his books. Tests are completely unpredictable and heavy on stats. Overall, not a bad course, but very dense."
1617,poor,"If you think calculus is hard as is and you feel like torturing yourself, then Professor Cook is for you. He refuses to use any type of technology to make understanding better for the student. No iclickers and attendance was not mandatory. He never explains things in a general form and just goes over random problems right in the beginning."
389,poor,"Holy crap take his class!  He can't even come up with new test or problem set questions.  Get some old tests and just use those to study.  He honestly just uses the same questions over and over.  He did have good stories and class was interesting, when I went."
3844,good,"Such a wonderful woman and really wants her students to succeed. That being said you have to work hard in this class, if you slack or do not try on assignments, you won't do well. Her exams require a full understanding of the material so her 300 level classes are not for people looking for an easy A. Her classes are meant for students in the major."
3618,average,It was really hard to understand her in my opinion. You have to go to class!!
1581,poor,"i think he is just a lonely guy, he makes an attempt to be available to all the students, but sadly he isn't very helpful, steer away from this class."
2956,good,"Fantastic Prof.  Clear, good lecturer, encourages student participation.  He is interesting, open minded.  Would highly recommend taking his course."
924,good,"Love her. This class was an easy summer class. I think there were 8-10 assignments. She gave a topic and we wrote 1-2 pages about it. She's an easy grader as well, not obsessed with punctuation. Her lectures are great. She has THE best personality. Sometimes shows sick/gruesome videos in class and has great stories. By far my favorite professor."
2799,poor,Most intelligent person I've ever met.
3718,good,She's incredibly nice and very approachable. Exams aren' t too tough and are mostly based off her lecture and power points so be sure to take good notes. Her lectures get pretty boring however unless your really into the subject. 
2508,good,What a Charmer!!!
2036,good,She is funny in class and interesting.  I was not interested in the class at first but I enjoyed and learned alot.
3775,good,"She's really nice, and you can tell she loves her subject and has lots of real-world experience. She uses I-clickers for in class points. Exams are super easy if you follow along with the study guides in class. Buy the lab manual, but not the textbook. I never even opened it."
1224,poor,No Comments
3216,average,I'll be honest. I took this class twice and passed the second time because I finally learned how to study for her exams. This class is extremely difficult but you can do it! Go over the questions on the connect quizzes OVER and OVER and OVER until you know the steps to solving each problem like the back of your hand. Use her office hours! Good Luck
3006,good,Funny professor. Love his in-class pep talks!
2549,good,He is a kick-a$$ prof.  but why the hell does he pour water in a mug&#63;
1946,good,"Take Writing in Biology with Goodenough! Really laid back course with minor assignments each week. Lectures can be boring, but she brings in snacks and tries to make it interesting. The main project isn't bad and once you finish it the class is basically over."
739,average,"Cook has been teaching for so long that he has his lectures pre-scripted in his head. He will teach Calculus to you but the math department at UMass is known for striving for student success. Do all the homeworks, use the video guides, go to review and discussion. Just pay a lot of attention in series! Most students fail here."
40,good,"Having seen the 106a lectures online and liked them, I wasn't particularly expecting anything new. yeah some of the material was familiar but Mehran was so much more good in person and such a great teacher, who really prepared me for some of the more difficult computing concepts."
868,average,"took calc in high school, and never went/ go to class and got an A in 127 and will get one in 128... boring class, puts me to sleep, and doesnt explain things well, so i dont go.  tests to the point usually."
2779,poor,Not nice
539,good,anyone who failed her class must have been frequently absent or brain dead.. this class was pretty easy
3249,poor,"A complete nightmare, avoid at all costs.  If you read the book cover to cover you'll be fine.  Going to lecture is pointless and she doesn't explain anything.  You can't look at your old exams even though the final is comprehensive.  She's crazy."
3387,good,"People give her a hard time, as they should for some things, like her strict policies on entering and exiting class. However, she is very clear and concise in her lectures and it is easy to pay attention because she moves around and what not.  You don't really have a choice who to take for 203 but just read the chapters do your work and you'll be o"
2745,good,NOT FOR DUMMIES!!!
3827,poor,Unbelievably boring.  Had her class in lecture hall only about 10 people showed up to her class everytime.  Talked about her kids a lot which was TOTALLY not related to the subject at matter.  Most people passed her class without showing up.
3954,good,Class was not bad but attendance is manadatory she covers so much material it is crazy. SAVE money don;t buy books cause you won;t need them
2723,good,"His tone is dry, slow, and is critized by most students. However I enjoyed his lectures because he delivers the &quot;materials&quot;. What that means is, if you've given full efforts in class and afterclass, you're going to get a great result. His tests are straightforward and no tricks."
1371,good,this was probably one of the best classes i've taken at umass. Tammy is really cool....and i thought she taught very well. She teaches with alot of video clips and does crazy experiments during class! overall...shes a really good teacher and her class was something i actually wanted to go to in the afternoon...highly recommend.
1145,good,"Bio is gonna be hard no matter who u take it with, but he is a really good teacher that actually cares about his students doing well, so if u can take it with phillis, hes pretty fair with everything and class is interesting! i got a C because the lab ta sucked! Avoid reem suleima as a ta!!"
1031,good,Randall Phillis is one of the best biology teachers I have ever had in my educational career. Taught the course better than my AP Biology teacher from high school. Allows you to ask questions and holds reviews every Thursday night for Friday quizzes. Also holds review sessions the night before every exam. Clicker questions in class are the key.
372,good,"I love Molumby, he was hilarious and I came to every lecture (I skip all my other lectures). He is very intelligent and knows his stuff. If you listen to him, you'll understand the material. People would say he's a hard grader but I call it fair. He won't put up with stupidity so don't come to him with things you could figure out on our own."
667,good,"I took it ONLINE. Like somebody said, he is a picky guy and doesn't like disagreeing with his opinions. There was 4 papers and 2 proctored exams: grammar and an essay on the final. He was somewhat careless about checking sources in my papers, but he did give me points back once I pointed that out. Overall, he's a good teacher and I learned a lot."
3479,good,"The lectures were very clear to understand but when it came to the exams she purposely rewords them to make them difficult(she even said so herself) at one point my class average for an exam was 50% I would suggest studying a head of time, she does not do attendance . SHE DOES NOT CURVE."
3019,poor,This is a very disorganized course. AbouHaidar says that he cares about his students but he doesn't even spend time organizing his notes!
357,average,"Hard, this class is hard.  And, it's boring.  He's a good lecturer, and makes class somewhat interesting, but the material overall is overly detailed and mundane.  The tests are hard, and they test the minituae of the lecture."
967,good,My favorite professor at UMass.  One of the only classes I can say I actually learned useful information in.  He makes a point to treat everyone like a peer rather than a subordinate.  One of few professors who remembers personal details about you and will go out of his way to help you out.  Thank you for an good semester!
2831,average,"one crazy course, one wild prof, what can i say&#63; too paranoid after the exam!"
2783,poor,"The worst instructor I've met in UofT. He's very arrogant, often humiliating the ones who raise questions. Like being late, can't tolerate any slightest talking in the auditorium. He doesn't follow the textbook, arrange concepts in his own way."
1353,good,"if you can take this class with her do so. One of the best classes ive had. shes the best teacher, love love love her."
1035,good,"Randy is a funny professor! He really tries to make the material as interesting as possible. However, his class is pretty tough, making us apply the knowledge we learned in class on exams. Plus he never really gives you the answers to any of his iClicker questions in class, so going to class is pretty important."
3018,good,"Great professor, cares about students.  Actually shows interest in the material. Notes easily obtained (much cheaper than textbook anyways.  Sometimes have to flip a few pages, but if that's your problem get out of UofT. In the top 3 of professors I have had."
470,good,"Excellent professor. If you get engaged in the discussion, you'll do fine. I had sevral Anth classes with him and he was excellent in each one and very helpful. Read the assignments and get involved in the discussions in class, pay attention to the films and videos he shows and an A should be no problem. No need for extra credit."
4088,poor,Attendance is required because of weekly in class grades. VERY slow returning graded work. Final and project not even returned. Feedback on work less than helpful. Exams are difficult and cover a lot. If you have to take IT 223 though you might as well with him because all teachers use his exams. Good luck. You'll need it with him.
3330,average,"This Professor does not like the students who come late or miss the class, that may impact your project grade. Be nice to her, she will be nice to you. I am writing this  because in my opinion her personal preferences are reflected in grades, so be careful"
3637,average,"she is a hard techer the test are confussing every question asks about which on ei is not ture, or ..... except. this sort of question.she gets carried away with her lectures. and makes thing more comlicated. trust me i took AP bio in high school, i passed the AP exam with a 4. but she makes everything seem extra hard.AVOID HER IF U CAN"
1396,good,She's an good professor.
3584,poor,DO NOT TAKE Fondufe if you're a not biology major. She expects too much from the students about information. The details are so dreadful and hard to memorize. Her tests will be really hard to understand since her accent is horrible! She's not willing to help you regardless your emergency situation and you will know about it the first day of class!
3812,poor,No Comments
4113,poor,The Harry Potter fans among us call this guy &quot;You-Know-Who&quot; or &quot;He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named&quot;.
1549,poor,He sucks.
3376,poor,"Talks too fast, doesn't give any response to your questions regarding projects, didn't curve our grades at all, after talking to a little less than half the class, I realizing that the class average was around 70-75%.  She never divulged the classes average, I think the ACC dept. at mason is shady"
1256,good,Great Professor. Gotta read to ace the class.
2094,poor,"Overall just kind of... boring. Most lectures are summarizing the readings (from his own books that are expensive) and brings up quantitative stuff constantly. If you go to a lecture he teaches, everyone around you will be playing solitaire or on Facebook, you can stay home if he's teaching. Also you only really need the Commit Sociology books."
3473,good,"Professor Fondufe is a great Professor. She is very passionate when she teaches and she is a very nice woman to talk too. Her exams are based on what she teaches in her class. Anyone who is looking for a very good Professor who is fair and very helpful professor, Professor Fondufe is a perfect Professor. I highly recommend her. She is the best!"
3512,good,Tests were exactly like the study guides- do the study guides and listen to lecture youll be fine . It helps to Print powerpoint notes and take notes during the lecture.  reading the book was also helpful but It wasn't mandatory. she helps you understand concepts and goes beyond for her students . easy A if you put the effort and go to class
1555,poor,do not take his class unless you want to be bored out of your mind and you want to dread going to class each and every day...this guy writes down word-for-word everything he says..it is veeeeerrrry annoying...
4082,poor,He is a very weird guy with minimum quality of a professor.  If you take his class you are in Lions den.
1250,good,"Tammy is on fire. Her class is good. Minimal effort for maximum grades. If you get atleast 60% on the quizzes, you get 100. Easiest gen ed at UMass. Great GPA booster. Not to mention she's frickin fine as heck. Hotmama status OVER 9000"
1699,poor,"go to EVERY class, take really good notes b/c most of his exam questions are based on examples in class, read the book. his exams are nothing he says it would be & the final is hard so u really gotta really know what the &quot;fundamental theorem of calc&quot; he always talks about is b/c that's what all his exams are about"
1252,good,"I took this class as a gen ed and loved it so much I'm considering minoring in psych. Tammy is such a good professor, she gives 4 exams and no final which are easy to pass as long as you do the textbook reading and show up to class. If you want to take psych100 do so with Tammy it's seriously the best class."
4230,good,"The lectures are allright, the lab is pointless but a grade boost. The exams in the class are rough, but it is partly because this class is a lot of psychology and I just don't get that subject. Overall the class was allright and there is not much contact with the professor herself."
4246,poor,"She's an easy teacher. Take her if you get a chance, but be ready for the CONFUSING exams. She's nice if you talk to her, but tries to be mean. Attending lecture helps. Read the book and slides for exams!"
3284,poor,bad bad bad
2933,average,"Tepperman's lectures are a waste of time. Just read his texts (yes &quot;his&quot;, he makes you buy his books) and memorize all the ridiculous, irrelevant statistics in order to navigate through the very tricky multiple-choice tests."
79,good,"I stumbled upon the CS106A lectures on iTunes U and found that professor Mehran Sahami really teaches brilliantly! His clear, structured, uncluttered explanations, and the very apt examples are a huge help in  understanding and retaining the concepts in ones mind.  I loved the lectures and learnt a lot. Such teachers make a difference. Thank you!"
1172,good,"Overall, he's a good professor. The only way to make it in his class is by attending regularly, since everything on exams comes from lectures. My only real criticism of him is that he occasionally oversimplifies complex concepts, which can confuse people."
814,poor,"THIS MAN IS THE WORST PROFESSOR @ UMASS. he doesn't take questions in class, goes over problems way too fast and with no clear direction to them. he doesn't use numbers in his problems ever even if a student yells to him that he should. if you are going to take Math 127 take it with Calden. I failed and will have to wait to declare my major."
1852,good,"Wonderful professor, wonderful class.  I HIGHLY recommend this class with her to everyone!  Stimulating for 9 a.m., helps you remember stuff through videos, game shows, contests, and TA skits.  Go to class not just for the random pop assignments, but because it's good. Do the work--easy points.  Got an A with B tests because of the other points."
2220,good,"a student's interest in a subject is TOTALLY based on the students 1st tutor! If you would give me a SOC textbook only, i wud NEVER have taken the initiative in the subject, but prof. brym made me love sociology! prof. brym is an awsome professor!"
2719,good,"Best professor in PSL 300/1/2. He is stereotypically clear and his lecture notes are just the same. His test questions were absurdly straight-forward (providing extensive study--i.e. no tricks). Easy A+, IF YOU HAVE TIME TO STUDY, because there is a lot of material."
684,good,"I wish more professors were like her, she knows how to keep you interested"
3966,good,"I'm sorry, but whoever says this class was an easy A must be on crack. The class was indeed easy, but it wasn't an easy A. Whoever says you don't need the book for this class is also on crack, unless you're a human recorder. The book is mandatory in looking up terms and other materials for the exams."
2105,poor,textbook very hard to understand and tests the class on the littlest details like stats and numbers. very little understanding of the course material even though i did all the readings and attended all lectures
133,average,"I would say avoid if it was possible, but it isn't at PSH. If you are a Comp Sci major, all he will do is make fun of you. Brutal grader, you can understand everything and still do bad on the exams. Final is basically impossible to prepare for. Oh yeah, he is extremely materialistic and will constantly brag about his base model Mercedes-Benz. poor"
1140,good,This class was challenging but not too hard. It has alot of focus on problem solving and biological systems and circuits. Not alot of memorization. Don't take it if you are easily confused although there are good review sessions.  I personally liked this class and I think Randy is a really good guy and a good teacher. He has a good sense of humor.
933,good,Overall great professor!! Class total 200 points. One midterm and one final. Both essay style. Attendance not mandatory but those who come get more information for essay styled questions.
928,good,LOVE HER! She is HILARIOUS. She does a test review on Thursday and the test is on Tuesday. she basically tells you exactly whats on the test. Her class is sofun
823,poor,"This guy is terrible, and completely incompetant.  He is unprepared for class not to mention 10 minutes late every class period.  You actually get about 25 minutes of bad teaching in the 50 minute block.  He is rediculously bad at explaining the material and should be banished from teaching."
3480,good,"Her tests are moderately hard, but definitely impossible if you study hard enough! She provides study guides, sample questions, and old iClicker questions on blackboard to use as study material for each exam. Definitely cares about her students and wants you to succeed. A very animated lecturer, and genuinely passionate about biology. Take her!"
3968,good,"Professor Bauman makes learning art history a pleasure. You don't mind sitting through class, because she makes what you learn exciting and interesting. Three simple projects throughout the semester, and three tests (including the final) which she gives you word for word study guides to."
1531,poor,RED ALERT.....STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN....classes are extremely boring because of his teaching techniques...writes too fast...does not explain material...must teach yourself the course...
1214,good,amazing teacher
504,good,HOT HOT HOT
4375,good,His lecture style is mesmerizing & his experience interesting. Great choice of lit. Review sheets are brilliant & generous. One of the best profs Ive ever had!
2395,good,"He's an AMAZING prof. His notes are thorough, and his tests may be hard but they are fair. His office hours are very useful and you can tell he enjoys what he does and truly cares about his students. It was a privilege having him as my chemistry professor this year, I only wish I got to know him a little better. He's not bad to look at either ;)"
1996,good,I LOVED THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Judy is the best!
2434,average,"If you refrain him from saying &quot;by virtue of the fact?,? then&quot; and &quot;presumably&quot;, he won't have anything left to say; but his lectures were quite engaging."
3072,average,The textbook is usually plenty to do an okay job in this class. Sometimes he doesn't go into enough detail/clarification in lecture.
1958,good,"This class was wicked easy. Theoretically, you could never show up except for on test days and get an A easily. However, you should want to go to the lectures regardless because Professor Goodenough is absolutely hilarious! She's extremely clear in her expectations and the course material is very relevant. Basically a funny, useful sex ed course."
1384,good,"class was fun, she gives 6 pop quizs very easy, these are done randomly throughout the year, its to make sure u read (any thing close to a correct answer is good enough) and it also keeps u coming to class, if u go to class and legit study an A should be easily atainable, i got a B and didnt study, shes a fun teacher and it is a fun class"
894,poor,"Boring, not clear and not good at preparing students for his exams which are MC"
828,poor,"I never went.. i got a C+. His class was pointless because he just confussed you and showed up late every time. So i stopped going, the cheat sheet tehy allow you to use on the tests really helped me. Just put examples from owls on it and you will be fine."
455,average,In order to do well in this class you must go to class and pay attention. If you take the notes and read the assigned readings the class isn't impossible. Nice Professor
2523,average,"His lecture notes sucked, his jokes were annoying, he made me want to sleep"
1683,good,"A great guy, sort of a funny but quirky sense of humor. He likes to teach the concepts and what's behind them rather than teaching you step-by-step processes, making it a little more difficult. You do a lot of self-teaching using the book and HW. Extremely clear! I loved how he went over things a few times until everyone understood. Doesn't EMail."
4063,poor,"Nice to see Lyons filling up his own page with positive comments, hoping maybe people will fall for it and take his terrible class. One word: no. Stay far, far away from this guy. If you must take IT223, take either of the Curts or Leary. They are far better professors, without ridiculously hilarious outbursts and annoying, moronic lectures."
4127,average,He really knows the subject but is a pretty hard teacher.  Projects take forever.  IT 221 exams were hard but IT300 exams were even harder. He is very MOODY
4032,poor,"He is one of the worse professer I ever had in GMU. He makes expectation clear but never respects students expectations. He never shows up in class on time and never returns grads comments for assignments on time. The online class I took, he posted midterm grade the night before the final exam and he didn't post any grades for homework assignments."
3958,good,"I LOVE HER! This was the first class I've taken where the 75 min flew by!  She's fun, inspiring, and helpful.  Just don't buy the books, they're interesting, but you don't need them for the course. Take her! ;-)"
652,good,Great teacher but do not take this class if you do not like to read or write. There was a lot more reading in this class in comparison with his 1301 class. And there was a lot more writing. His grading is very consistent though so it is possible to make changes and try for a higher grade on the next paper. Overall it was a good class though!
172,poor,"He does not teach. I sit in the front and I still cannot understand a word he is saying. It is not clear what to study for the exams. The book goes into much more detail than is needed for the course, so I'm not sure why he keeps telling us to read the book. The TA's even told me they didn't know how to answer certain q's on old exams..."
3522,good,"Extremely clear and it's easy to tell she has a passion for biology.  Adorable and funny, perfect balance of fun and work. Pay attention consistently, take notes, study and you'll get an A like I did"
3197,poor,"I am a freshman and if you're looking for an easy A do not take Prof Hylton. There is a lot of reading and studying to be done if you want at least a C in the class. There is a homework and quiz assigned every weekend, study them A LOT if you don't want to bomb the tests. Exam 1 was a wake up call to almost the whole class. Good luck!"
38,poor,"I'm sorry to all POLI students at Valparaiso. She has taught before at Roanoke College, so check that page also for more comments on her teaching. Most of those comments are in line with what the students at Valparaiso have said...beware of this professor if you value your sanity and GPA."
3602,good,"Goood Teacher....alll her notes are online, dont really need to go to class, except for the three pop quizzes andd she tells you when theyre going to be!! Take her easy B...A if you study well for the tests!"
1881,average,"Easy... but she definitely teaches down to the class. Its a very easy Gen Ed, but if youre looking to learn, this isnt the class for you."
713,good,By far the greatest teacher i have ever had! so  so so nice and easy...u can hand in your weekly journals late.  Just show up and you'll DEFINATELY get an A
90,good,"Oh how I love Dr. Sahami! He's funny, smart, and LOVES to teach! I'm on video 7 of his CS 106A class (I don't attend Stanford); he's THE BEST EVER! Now I can say I UNDERSTAND Comp Sci! I took 2 CS classes at my own alma mater and HATED it each time. Now I LOVE IT! THANK YOU Mehran! YOU TOTALLY ROCK! (I added a hot chili pepper for bonus lol :))"
2214,good,Exams are hard and focus on very specific details; really have to know your stuff upside down. Good prof.
1205,good,One of my favorite lecturers. Kept the material interesting and incorporated his good sense of humor often.
2923,poor,Ever since i took his first class soc101 I avoided him ever since--not helpful at all and very arrogant like he runs****--
3893,good,"VERY nice! Don't bother buying the book. Not needed. Won't put slides online, must write them all down. If you can memorize definitions you should do fine. The professor is almost embarrassed that she teaches ARTH 101, she makes it harder than it should be, to make it like an upper level. She can't accept it's for gen ed."
4078,good,"I loved his jokes, they were very funny. His examples were great and entertaining. But, he is hard to talk to, you have to ask smart questions and give smart answers (which makes sense). If he wasn't hard to approach to he would be my favorite teacher. Materials are easy, but answering them on test is hard, you got to be clear and explain well."
3486,good,"Ok here it is... Her ppts are EXTREMELY long (80-100+ slides) and detailed so DON'T wait till the last minute to study for exams. Go to class regularly and ask questions. She's more than happy to help. There's weekly hw but they're all super easy, just use quizlet. Exams are mc and she gives extra credit. Overall she's a decent prof. Take her."
3323,poor,"My class started with over 100 students only about 36 students could stand her.  She tries real hard to fail the students.  Trust me she will mess up your GPA, I'm warning you.  I spent lots of time studying hard, she's only available to help students 5 min. after class ends. she's a bad teacher."
3141,poor,"His class is a nightmare. Thankfully I already know all the calculus concepts we're going to cover: otherwise I would be screwed. It's not that the material itself is hard, but rather that he is completely unintelligible half the time during his lectures. He often makes mistakes during calculations, so more than once I've had to rewrite my notes..."
1827,average,"Pretty easy class, pain in the ass to go to at 9AM and she always always runs over. Talks about herself constantly and gives review points for exams but puts questions on the exams that have nothing to do with them. I wish i took it with a different professor."
1155,good,"Prof. Phillis is a very enthusiastic teacher who will keep you engaged during the whole class.  He sometimes is a little vague during lectures, but makes sure everyone understands the information before the easy exams he gives."
1324,good,"Tammy is fairly good. She's interesting and funny and made a 9am class not so terrible. Her tests are easy and drops the lowest one making the final optional for some. Good class, would take others with her and I'm not even a Psych major."
216,poor,"I had him for 101 and that class was easy A so I thought it would be like that for 240. But I was TOTALLY wrong. He's the worst professor you can take for 240. His lectures are 100+ slides, skips about half of them, rambles on, test questions are very hard/tricky, doesn't reply to e-mails, and no curve. Impossible to get an A unless u r super smart"
3398,average,"She's the only teacher for 203, so there's no other choice.  Lectures are pretty straight forward and she goes over quiz material before you take it.  I didn't read the text book at all and survived on the study guide alone.  Only 2 exams, 3 quizes, and 1 final, so there isn't really any room to mess up.  Start off well and you'll be fine."
510,good,"An eccentric teacher, but interesting. Well from what I experienced from the short amount of time I spent in class. I showed up for most classes till the first test and got an A on it. I decided not to go to class anymore and got the notes online and still did well. Didn't buy book. Easy class."
1680,poor,"Guy is a terrible teacher. He just gets up to the board and writes down random stuff doesn't really go over it very well. Uses WileyPlus which is $50 and you need to buy it because thats where the homework is, and wiley sucks doesn't help you learn at all. I like math have a B but this class is so bad do not take it with him. Exams sucked"
499,good,"This guy is definately a unique individual. But regardless of how he is as a person, I would rate him as a good professor. He is sometimes boring, granted the topic is intro to archaeology. I was only taking it for Gen Eds, but it turned out to be somewhat of an interesting class. Funny guy, tricky quizzes and tests but you'll pass if you study"
3900,good,"I wish more teachers were like her! I'm a senior who needed this to satisfy a credit boy am I glad I took her class! She is so spunky, funny, sweet, & extremely approachable! She teaches the material well, attendance is mandatory she takes role but your going to want to go to this class. Her stories are insanely funny."
1856,good,"Professor Whitbourne, is a little crazy at times, but she means well. The exams are good as long as you study! I can't stress that enough! Her ways of teaching allow the students to remmeber things so although attendance isn't mandatory I would go! Plus she plays music at the beginning of class as a wake up call! This is a good gen-ed take it!"
1388,good,"good class, u should get an A if u put a little effort into the class...i didnt but i still did well....only class i wouldnt skip"
1519,average,"He is a smart guy, knows his stuff. Class is fairly easy.  Use your book, highly recommended. Exams are mediocre, if you know your material, they are pretty easy. Questions are sometimes very tricky. OWLs are  decent, you get unlimited tries so I cant complain."
3719,good,"Kim is the sweetest women alive. She makes it an introductory science course because it is. You have ample opportunity to pass her class, and if you don't you really have no one to blame but yourself."
2386,good,"People are complaining that the midterm was extremely hard. If you attend class and do what he says, you will be fine. Overall, very clear, helpful, energetic prof. Best prof I've had so far"
4197,good,Can't argue with an online lecture and an easy lab. The online/lab format worked our great for my work schedule.
3236,poor,"Some people must get a lot of satisfaction from ruining people's lives. Accounting is already a difficult course, students do not need a professor like Hylton to make it even harder. She refused to answer a student's question in my class about a homework assignment even though he tried to ask consistently. She is a horrible professor. AVOID!"
2076,good,"good teacher, funny, makes you actually want to go to class"
1540,poor,"save yourself...ruined my gpa and so forth. hes creepy and weird. dentures, ponytail, 'nuff said"
1217,good,ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS. STUFF IS HARD BUT GUY EXPLAINS IT UNTIL IT IS CLEAR!
2681,average,No Comments
2842,poor,"what the heck&#63;&#63; hard or not, fair or not, i did not learn ANYTHING from him. i don't care the the F--- my mark is, i want to learn something. i learned everything on my own and McDunno just confused me. WORST PROF EVER"
2993,good,one word: good!
1416,good,She makes the class fun. She's always in a good mood.
2217,average,dropped course after 4 lectures. thinks he knows everything - but doesnt. he should loosen up a bit.
3969,good,"She's an good professor; very energetic and passionate about her teaching. The one thing I dislike about the class is the amount of materials needed to be memorized for the exams. Don't get me wrong, they are EASY, just too much to memorize for a 100 level course. I don't have to memorize that much in my Physics class."
1676,average,"really nice guy. willing to help if you ask. a little out of his element as far as technology goes, but actually cares about his students."
1197,good,"BEST prof I've EVER had, BAR NONE.  VERY VERY clear in lecture, problem based in his teaching methods (asked classtalk questions before he fully covered the material, requiring you to use what you know to reason out an answer).  TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM"
1542,poor,No Comments
3301,poor,"Biggest Bitch at Mason. She wouldn't let me see my own exam after it was graded. She speeds through the material and her notes on the board are sloppy. Strict on cell phones, laptops, and behavior.Honestly, avoid taking her."
3960,good,"Dr. Bauman is a wonderful professor.  Her lectures are interesting and I found myself looking foward to class. She keeps the material interesting by the way in which she presents it, and her energetic and fun attitude make her a pleasure to be around and talk to.  I have to say that she is my favorite professor in my four years at Mason."
2960,average,No Comments
2539,good,he is a really good prof...and hot too!!!
953,good,Christopher is the best Prof at west ga. she is very very helpful with everything. she is very open minded and if you give 100% she will give you 200% back. she is good and i would reccommend her to anyone even if you dont like sociology. and she always dresses really nice:) she is always in new clothes haha:)
3145,poor,"his test are so random, and no matter how hard you study you need luck to do well on his tests. he teaches by using transparencies, and his lectures are so boring. most of the class is asleep. he just rewrites the examples in the textbook for his lectures"
3080,good,"Course content wasn't so hard, and professor Flaherty teaches really well. Lectures are clear, and interesting. Assignments are partially in textbook and are not difficult. Exams are pretty easy as long as you are careful in lectures and do the homework. "
2635,average,"lectures were quite useless, since she just read off the slides...the tests were extremely hard, not representing what was taught to us. also she is quite UNFAIR because she changed the percentage weighings of tests and exam for some and for other people she just told them to try harder!!!"
750,good,"If you don't mind getting into the actual theory behind basic calculus, Cook is great. He's an older guy, and an old-fashioned lecturer, but I find it charming and refreshing. The exams are easy if you know how to make good use of your calculator, attend class, and follow the text somewhat. I don't know why people are so down on him..."
2705,poor,"Simply Horrbile!!! The only team that can take the most interesting course and make it the worst!!! Simply uninspiring prof... poor grasp of communication skills, lecture skills, and making content relevant"
234,poor,just like everyone else on here... i advise you to stay away. he knows people look off his old exams. changed up his new ones. and seriously.. just teach the material and stop talking about life stories man. getting an easy going TA is crucial.
732,good,"Randy is a great professor and makes the material very easy to understand. However his tests are difficult and test more on the application of the than knowledge.  His class 151 is great, however I would find it to be more difficult if I had not taken AP Bio in high school. Overall his class is good, his exams are just really difficult. "
1238,good,Professor Rahhal is super nice and funny. Theres some very light weekly reading and online quizzes and occasional in-class pop-quizzes. Easy tests and she lets your drop your lowest test. No final and easy A.
4187,poor,"I enjoyed taking the class . you need this class  but honestly i dont think you should take this class with others classes , i have been reading the book , listening to slides with no use .Exams are not related neither to lecture nor the book she is useless so dont take it with her ."
1156,good,Best biology teacher i've ever had!  He is so funny and he teaches the subject in a way that makes it interesting and easy to understand.  His review sessions help out a lot.
4062,poor,"Ugh, I hate this professor. He's not even my professor, but he writes the hws and tests/quizzes and they're graded according to his rules. There are so many mistakes in the directions to the HW assignments and students have to correct him. He wants the exact answers for everything. Very annoying."
4003,poor,"This guy is the prime example of whats wrong with academia. He is rude, opressive, and has no clear understanding/vision of the course. He is more involved in kicking students out of class because they drank out of a water bottle than teaching Information Defense Technologies. When he does, he speaks for two hours about vietman and WWII battles."
2445,poor,Sucks
2982,good,"Good professor. His teaching is pretty monotonous, but his personality and commitment to the students make taking Virology worthwhile."
1209,good,No Comments
1065,average,Randall is a really good teacher! At first I hated him but I really like Bio so as long as you apply yourself you will do well. I strongly suggest going to the SI Review Sessions. You won't know your grade until the end of the semester. Overall great class.
3764,good,"She is ADORABLE. Her lectures are straightforward, she always is in a good mood. The studyguides she posts normally have the same &#63;s as on the tests so look at them! U don't have to go to class, but she does do iclicker &#63;s so you don't want to miss too many classes. She offers so much extra credit & is just a good person. The lab was pretty rough."
2156,good,Robert Brym is an excellent professor
1062,poor,Randy is much more of a scientist than a professor. His lecture slides arent explained well and the exams are very difficult to do well in. He took forever getting our grades back- I found out all 4 of my exam grades during the last week of the semester. I wish I had enrolled with a different professor for Bio 100
2616,good,A very approachable professor who will spend a lot of time during office hours or between breaks explaining questions about the course. That being said if you've taken accoutning in high school your pretty much set. No point going to classes because the textbook has the answers in the back and the slides from the lecture.
1167,average,Lectures are entertaining and fun but he tends to go really fast and is hard to keep up with.  Do the reading before class and you'll be set.  Exams are really tricky so go to review sessions and study.  Great guy though.. i'd take another class with him!  HWUA!!
3222,average,"Study a lot for the tests, and you'll be fine. And I mean, A LOT."
3636,good,"Shes a fun teacher to watch , cuz she'll dance while teacher the lecture. Pretty much just know the entire chapter for the tests. focus on the little words underneath the pictures. She likes to have questions on those. Study hard and you should be fine. Comin to class doesn't really help. SHe's aiite though"
3555,good,A lot of people say her tests are difficult but I couldn?t disagree more.  A week in advance she posts a study guide for the upcoming test and while she doesn?t have the same questions the same concepts are covered. She doesn?t try and trick you on tests either all the questions are straight forward.
1492,good,Helpful.
2938,poor,Interesting materials but workload is too high. Sometimes his lecture is confusing.
2995,poor,Most unorganized prof ever!
3096,good,"Flaherty, King of Calculus"
3894,good,"I learned a lot from the way she lectured. She's a great professor! very helpful, smart and motivating! Take her!"
4151,good,"Lyons really isn't that bad.  He is intimidating, and he always seems like heis mad, but really his tests and assignments are not that hard.  In fact, they encourage you to read the book more than other teachers' assignments do.  I LOVE how he talkes about dickheads.  All teachers should."
3140,poor,"I fall asleep every week in this class and end up learning more, in the recitation than during lecture. He starts every class with, &quot;I am going to review what we did last time.&quot; You do the math, but that means you don't move forward, at all."
884,average,"Nice guy, I went to nearly every class, when it came time for the exam, I realized I hadn't learned most of the material."
143,average,"Dull, dull, dull.  Guess what&#63;  When you try and reduce literature to philosophical argument IT DOESN't WORK."
1390,good,"amazing class.  she is an good proffesor.  she made the material interesting and fun.  even in a huge class, she got people involved and made it a little more interactive.  i want her to teach all of my classes"
3577,poor,Not a good teacher. Lectures are insanely dull. I was knocked out within 20 minutes of every class I actually went to. Powerpoint slides make it easy to skip class though. I went to less than half the classes. I just used the slides and the book and I got an A easy.
850,poor,"Very good personality, but if you have no idea or interest in math, you will find the course very difficult.  He is an intelligent man whose jokes carry the class more than his explanations.  If you do not want to spend time in extra help, do not take the course with him."
3635,good,good teacher. come to class and take good notes. tests are not hard at all. just reading from the book is enough and she sometimes takes questions straight from the book cd. overall good teacher
3455,average,"She's very weird, dont come to class late, and just do all your homework and study alot."
2782,poor,The worst of the worst. Do not even think about taking his course... I can get 100% in the midterm but fail in the final... I think I am good...
717,good,"I had her for interpersonal relations! AMAZING woman..soo nice and down-to-earth. Every class you sit in a circle and gossip/talk about each other's problems. I miss her class already! Easy Grader! 11 journal entries, 1 group presentation, & midterm/final"
1819,poor,"Whitbourne has suchhh an annoying personality. She talks about herself ALL the time. Her slides and notes can be unorganized and all over the place. But overall, the class was not hard and was interesting at times."
2502,good,"Um... great prof, funny (kinda).  But, what does the &quot;C&quot; stand for in Dr. C. Scott Browning&#63;  Weird."
264,good,From what I understand Molumby is pretty difficult in the BIO 101 class but I highly reccommend him for Homeostasis! He is a very interesting lecturer and really funny! Yes his tests are kinda difficult but I did surprisingly well on his tests. Very cool guy!
75,good,"The most inspiring professor I've ever had. Helpful, funny (i mean extremely funny), and clear. He does his best to entertain students. I have never took any CS class before and now I am in love with computer programming because of him. Class is of course not that easy, and there are always at least 500 students, but it is all worthwhile."
4265,good,"Go to lecture, go to lab, read and study.  As simple as that.  Dr. Wolf is very nice and has experience to back up her lectures.  Good examples.  Tests are mostly situational to a business enviornment so learn the concepts not just the definitions and you'll do just fine!"
2492,good,He actually made sense on what he was teaching ... made perfect sense ... I liked that fact that he doesn't like sing his calculator and didn't put many calculator related questions on the tes ... eg. buffers ... but it was only out of 40 ... found that w
395,good,"Was the most fun I've had in a Bios class at UIC, but his exams kicked my @$$"
4016,average,You will have project that would pretty much control information. It might change from semester to semester. The project is effort based but your grades are off the just peer evaluations. The tests are written and have specific questions. One of the question was a quote which he didnt even mention before. Avoid him!
2224,good,"People give him a hard time, I think he's a good lecturer.  Any guy who is good at talking to that many people is going to be slightly full of himmself.  and the class is not that hard."
3090,good,He has a well planned out lecture that involves some very simple proofs and examples. His hws sometimes have some questions that require some thought but are usually straightforward. His tests are relatively easy I would say.
4255,average,"Good class, very generic.  Studying a must as not all exam material is completely covered to the extent needed to get an &quot;A&quot;.  Weakness:  Exam's are created by the publisher which makes Wolfe appear lazy.  If they were unique, they'd be returned so that you learn from your mistakes."
396,good,"Pretty easy professor, easy exams if you know your stuff, and interesting lectures.  he is pretty funny sometimes."
1365,good,"Rahhal is amazing, i never thought i could be so interested in going to a class. everyday she had something interactive and interesting to do and she always brought new material together with fun stuff. not a hard class at all. all lectures are online. def an easy A"
3936,good,"Great teacher, not as easy as everyone leads you to believe.  Just study her notes, memorize the pictures, and understand the concepts behind them and you'll get an A/B.  Attendance is mandatory/necessary to get the notes."
1903,good,"Very creative teacher (and clumsy too!) she really does get the class involved. a class of over 400 kids, and she knows the names of about half of them. that is impressive! she mixes up her teaching style a lot, which is great. cannot be held responsible for tech errors. TAKE THIS CLASS!"
595,good,"Long lecture style, but I learned so much.  I've been in classes with lots of student group discussions and though it is enjoyable I can't say I learned anywhere near as much as this class.  There are pros and cons to EVERY teaching style.  Just stay positive, do the work, buy into what he is trying to do, and you will grow in the best ways."
2109,average,A very smug and arrogant man. He is a great professor though and his tests are very easy.  Professor Brym has a strong left-wing bias. He seems to despise everything that Canada stands for. He spends half the class preaching on how sentences should be reduced for criminals and the other half idolizing the Swedish welfare system.
1296,good,"Tammy is nice, relatable, funny, and intelligent. The class is big, but she makes it worth it. Don't take Psych 100 with anyone else."
1821,good,"Okay class, not too boring, and at times, somewhat interesting. Good to take though if you need another psych class bc it's relatively easy.Whitbourne's very annoying but ignore her.Exams on:examples in class, review points in notes, and some spark q's.Annoying but easy spark homework quizzes and surveys.I recommend."
872,poor,Nice guy.  Bad Teacher
4092,poor,If you think you can get away from this guy by taking another teacher think again. The teachers in the other IT 223 sections use his same slides and tests to teach the class.
2264,good,"Wonderful speaker, could have been a politician in another life . . ."
2326,good,very entertaining and interesting lectures.  If you come to class and read: A+
1548,poor,by far the worst teacher i ever had
3766,good,"Gives really straight forward lectures; does not rely very much on the text. Really thorough lecture slides that are really all you need for the exams.  Also,she gives you study guides for each chapter that is a must for tests.  Kind of boring but that might be me.  Tries hard to keep material interesting.  Seems very passionate about the field."
3440,good,"She's a great teacher. Her classes are hard, but if you do your best you'll get a good grade. She's professional and experienced and one of the best teachers at Mason in my opinion."
3851,good,"I came into the class thinking I would hate it, being a required gen ed and all. Lisa immediately changed that and it ended up being my favorite class. She is really funny and super passionate about her class. Tests are straight forward, go to class and take notes and you won't need the optional book."
36,poor,"Very unclear and hard to follow, the class was a total waste of time."
3807,average,"This might be the easiest class at Mason.  If you TRIED to fail, you would still get a C.  I stopped going to class halfway through the semester, except for the exams, and I still got an A."
4106,average,Try to avoid as much as possible. He copyright's his lecture notes. He's always right so don't bother saying anything not included in his slides. Boring class and the project is extremely long unless you started working on it the first day of class.
2710,good,"better than the rest of teaching team, especially with bob cheung aka the worst prof in the world"
3983,good,"Extremely interesting class. She's devoted to art, very helpful, and her lectures are spectacular. You will learn a lot. Assignments are clear and interesting. Ask her after class or go to her office hours, it will make things a lot easier. Loved her and her class."
2143,average,So full of himself.
4275,average,"Don't bother going to class. Do the study guides, skim the chapter, show up for tests and quizzes. But don't frick up on the quizzes because there aren't very many of them."
977,good,"I have Michael for junior year writing (Management Communications). By far one of the coolest and best professors I've had. The things we do in class are relevant to the real world, he grades fairly easy, and the classes go by fast. Highly recommend taking his class."
1571,poor,No Comments
1122,good,"great teacher, very tough if you suck at bio though, try to get him if your a bio major because all other intro bio teachers pretty much suck."
3760,good,"Prof Largen is a really sweet lady. She clearly loves what she does and it definitely shows. The class is pretty easy but there is a good bit of work in terms of homework (none some weeks, a lot another week) and the lab definitely is miserable. Still, this class is your best bet if you are just trying to get rid of your science gen ed."
2786,poor,"rambles on, hard to read notes, gaps in logic in notes and gaps in the notes. if you go through and redo all the notes it helps, midterm == the practise test."
2239,good,"Prof. Brym is a great lecturer. He has a very unique point of view in many things. I like his clarity in expressing his views. Also, he's helped me learn a lot about life and understand the world better, which is beneficial for life!"
2967,good,One of the funniest professor I have ever seen!!
2504,average,Very very kind and understanding.
1892,good,"She made class interesting/fun by showing videos and demonstrations in class, but sometimes it was a bit much.  EASY class. The thing I hated was how she babies her students - she treats you like your in grade school not college.  Doesn't seem to think students can take care of themselves."
3465,average,"Prof. Fondufe is alright. I only went to class 3x til I realized lectures were unnecessary if you understand the reading/material. All slides go up online, she gives very thorough study guides, there are 2 tests and a cumm. final. Online weekly hw takes a while, though. Easy to do well w/out going to class, but must do well in lab to pass."
675,good,"Ha, too easy for words."
2808,poor,"His proofs are rediculous and he makes students to read them at home from internet, without explanation in class. Terrible!!!"
3068,poor,loves webassign way too much
3348,poor,"She is okay in teaching. But you can't mess with her.  Watch what you say, because she will take it so personal. She got an attitude problem. You will also get hurt by what she says.  This class is like riding roller coaster. so thrilling.  Make sure you smile and think twice before you ask questions as to how you ask those questions."
728,average,"Mister Monotone! Can we say &quot;Zzzzz...&quot;&#63;! Don't get me wrong, he's full of knowledge, but no matter how hard I try to focus, I just can't seem to get through one lecture without having my mind wander. Easy class, but prepare to read a lot at"
3491,good,Very enthusiastic with the subject. She knows her stuff. Power points outlines her lecture well.
3447,good,"She's a great teacher, one of my most favorite actually. If you attend class and put in an honest effort you'll do fine."
412,good,"He is such a great teacher because he really knows his stuff.  He's a bit of a nut with insects, but it's interesting.  His exams were not impossible, but attending lectures and reading his slides will really help.  His grading scale was pretty decent and the curve helped a lot of people."
3146,poor,This professor was the worst one I've had yet at Carnegie Mellon...I had to teach myself the material and the curriculum coverage was so much more than the exam coverage. Horrible professor.
1516,poor,"i would have to agree with the post made 2 spaces below mine. the people who don't show up for class are the ones that get confused and fail the tests. rudvalis is smart but a horrible teacher, so deal with it. the tests are EXACTLY like owls. plow through the owls, understand them, and you'll do fine."
1649,average,"This was oddly the easiest class of my life. I actually never went (and never took Calc in highschool). Show up the week before an exam and you are set when he reviews everything. His exams are not hard, you just need to know what formulas to apply. I'm still confused why people say his class is difficult."
3572,good,"Best proffessor I have had at Mason! Very knowledgable, especially in personal conversations outside of class. Record the class because she gives hints to the exams. Most persons who struggled either weren't at a proper lvl of knowledge for the class or did not come regularly."
825,poor,"He is completely unprepared for class.  He rushes in 10 minutes after the class is supposed to begin and just does some random problems out of the book that take him about 5 minutes to find.  He seems like his passion for the subject is gone because he does not motivate you to learn.  He is a nice man, just not a good professor."
3267,poor,"Absolute joke of a teacher, and much worse of a human being. It's very hard to pass a class when Hylton is yelling at you and bragging about how many people she fails and sends to the honor committee every semester. Perhaps if she spent more time on learning what she &quot;teaches&quot; it would be a worthwhile experience. For your sake, take someone else."
616,average,"Nice guy, interesting lectures, BUT unrealistic expectations on exams.  Multiple choice matching (characters to dialogue)(must read all literature), multiple choice (historical content), short answer (usually 2)(2 paragraphs of content rich information), AND a fully composed 5 paragraph essay. 3 exams, all containing above sections."
114,good,"Hired as a lecturer, he does the job well.  Cheerful, friendly, and fun."
417,good,GOOD PERSON EXPLAIN WELL HAS A CURVE for GRADES  A LOT OF POP QUIZs MUST ATTEND LEC
3069,poor,"Calc3D is easy to me. The book was good enough for most of the class. I still went to most lectures, which were helpful until the 3rd unit & he stopped making sense. He teaches from slides that are copied&pasted from the textbook. I was doing well on track for a B until he gave us an impossible final that destroyed my GPA. Very disappointed in him."
1625,good,"He is the nicest person. His lectures are really amazing , inspired me to study Math. This is not a high school , I believe he is a great teacher."
3017,good,He is the best prof that i've had at UofT so far...he really does care about how u do in the class and is always available for extra help.  i would recommend this course to anyone!!!
2652,poor,Has no clue how to give the exams I am assuming she gets some sadistice pleasure out of failing first year students . Take engineering it will probably be better .
4353,good,He's one of the easiest teachers ever... i took him during the summer and you dont really need to go to class... he gives you a study guide with all the questions that will be on the exam... and he gives you 3 parts and each part you get to pick  the &#63;s that u want to answer... my recommendation take him during the summer!!
89,good,He is a good teacher and he knows how to affect students
2896,good,I liked him a lot. I think that if people were more interested in what he had to say than their iPhone screens we would live in a better world.
4112,poor,His is very hard on students.
2082,good,"she prints out all the notes, and loves the sex lectures"
753,poor,"Cooks an good guy, but now he's so old he does not care at all.  Completely checked out and his teaching style shows.  I learned more about the 60s than I did anything about math.  If you have to take him to go another professors lectures or teach yourself online.  Avoid if possible"
2546,good,"says ""we can play that game"" alot ans pours bottled water into a mug..good prof"
3324,good,"You should know everything she will be talking about in class, if not, you will be lost. She definitely is very knowledgeable professor and does try her best to be helpful but she has a terrible habit of yelling. So, if you are a foreigner, don't take a class with her, because we tend to repeat the questions and when that happens, she EXPLODES!!!!"
3373,poor,"DO NOT take her. don;t know how to teach, does not give clear instructions for project, she does not even know what is on her test. she just takes tests right from the book site. do not take her. test on average 67%, test 2--43-48%(she would not tell us the right number), third test don' t know"
1630,poor,I didnt take Calc in High School so I went in expecting to learn it. Nope. If you take his class get ready to spend hours in the help center in Lederle and the LRC. Looking at the review for the exam makes you realize exactly how little he covered during lecture. 
11,average,"Good if you like a teacher who knows her stuff; you'll learn a lot in this class if you pay attention. However, it requires an insane amount of work. You better keep up on current events and READ THE TEXT. Fond of pop quizzes."
2444,average,"On a personal level, Browning is a great guy. He's very down to earth and friendly. On a teaching level, he's quite unclear at times. Lecture notes are overwhelming to study from (as numbers are randomly used without any guidance as to why or when to use them) and it makes studying off of them difficult."
284,poor,He only talks to the students in the front and refuses to use the microphone. The only time he would use it is to say &quot;There is no God&quot; during lectures. He uses iclickers and does not curve at all. Labs and TAs are useless. The exams are easy if you study old exams but not the ones he posts. Lectures are boring and people always talk over him.
4284,good,"If you show up to class and take notes, you don't even need to open the book. Lectures are fun and not boring. if you have a question ask it in the lecture and he'll give the answer (may be long). Do study guides they help (also quizlet too)"
1066,poor,"Do not take this class with Randy. he is very confusing, his exams are ridiculously hard, and you will never find out your grades. the semesters almost over and I still don't know what I have..."
3913,good,"good teacher, really funny and sweet, but can be blunt. Don't give her BS and you're good. Show up and take notes, and try to find a way to ask her about her visit to the Vatican Vault; it is THE BEST story you will ever hear."
1191,good,good teacher
1440,good,She is a fantastic teacher.
3648,good,Attending her lectures are like going to a performance. She provides a lot of motivation. Which is critical to class success. Not found in your upper level prof. at Mason
3906,average,This prof. is not easy at all. But her class is not boring at all. Not easy an A.
4262,good,"She is pretty nice professor.You can feel she puts lots of effort in this class.However,this class is kind of more theoretical than practical,the vedio shown in the class makes more sense than lecture.You will learn some researching findings in the class.The extra-credit exercise are helpful about final grade and you will learn more about yourself."
4259,good,"Good teacher. She teaches mainly through PowerPoint slides. She shows a video clip every now and then that may show up on the exams. Exams are not that bad as long as you understand the concepts. Attending the lab section is way more important, and is also a way to gain points."
3498,good,"Very good professor. If you want to pass and get a good grade take her, excellent teacher makes you understand the material. Have to work for it but she makes it better and improves chances of getting good grades."
2738,poor,No Comments
4185,good,"All you people who think this class is hard are stupid. Dont buy the book, just watch the online lectures, and get a guaranteed A. I'm the not the smartest person, but I just watched the online lecture twice and got a high grade on all of the exams. If you take the online lecture you only have to go to lab which is a waste of time. SUPER EASY CLASS"
1568,poor,"This guy is one of the worst teachers i ever had. He doesnt know how to teach, writes notes 'word for word', and does not at all teach. I say unless you know the subject matter before taking his class, or you're good at teaching yourself, don't take it because you really won't learn anything."
2427,good,"Watch out, he's got the tough tests."
3746,average,"She's not that good of a professor. You basically have to attend every class because the iClicker questions count as attendance. Studying for her exams is easy, it's basically all from the guides that she provides. They are long as hell, but if you get through them, you're guaranteed an A."
2737,poor,Don't forget your pillow for those long Con Hall lectures!
4066,good,"I'm not sure why other students gave him a poor rating, but he is a good teacher. Like others have said, he's not there to babysit anyone."
1687,poor,"Only reason I passed this class was because he broke his hip and Adena Calden stepped in to teach.  Rambles on for 20minutes before he gives you the one equation you need.  So hard to follow.  Old School teaching methods. Horrible jokes.  Take 128H with Calden.  Its honors but it will be easier. If you do take it, buy the book and teach yourself."
851,poor,Not a good teacher
3546,good,Explains everything with clarity and enthusiasm. A professor that actually doesn't put you to sleep! Best professor ever.
2207,poor,For those of you who are into marxism and communism this course is for you.  There is an incredible bias in this class and offers no real indication of anything possitive to take from sociology
895,poor,No Comments
496,good,Don't take if you are lazy.  Class was reading and writing intensive so don't expect to slack and do well.  He was very helpful with my topic.
2305,average,"An poor, poor man."
1782,poor,"Boring, not clear and not good at preparing students for his exams which are MC"
335,good,He is EXTREMELY knowledgeable and interesting. His class is relatively difficult but if you are interested in biology you are going to love him.
2839,average,funny as hell prof. i used to be intimidated by his personality but i realized that he's all jokes. sta447 is tough but managed a good mark because there were under 30 students. wouldn't recommend taking sta257 with him.
3087,good,Flaherty is THE man. His lectures are structured like a comedy show. It is virtually impossible to fall asleep in his class (without waking up with him standing in front of your face). He has also helped me to discover my life passion for topology.
515,good,"I agree, the lecture when it came to the subject werent all that hot, but when it came to current events they were. Just read ur lecture notes online and u'll do fine. BTW, stay for the movies; they're good thou they're old"
1348,good,"Probably the best professor I've ever had. Makes lectures fun and entertaining. She tells stories relating to the material, and does demonstrations and shows videos. You should definately take her class."
1015,good,The man is the reason I can actually understand Biology. His lectures are engaging and his comfort in front of and control of the lecture hall is truly remarkable. 
2816,poor,No Comments
1631,poor,"If you didn't take calculus in high school, like I didn't, you're gonna have a hard time.  He only teaches the basic principles, and the exams are much more complicated.  The homework is all online, but his lectures are almost 2 weeks behind the homework due dates.  If I wanted to teach myself calculus, I would have taken it online."
2489,good,Browning is one of the best profs so far!! He would even be available for counselling and very honest! But he's not boring! He's a really well-rounded prof!
3730,good,"Professor Largen is great, she's extremely helpful, very sweet and makes it a point to see that you're doing well in the class. Definitely take her, she's fantastic. There are 4 exams a lot of ""top hat"" which makes attendance ""mandatory"" 8 case studies but the class is not hard."
2809,poor,His notes are helpful if you understand his writing. And the tests have nothing to do with the textbook and problem sets.
3977,good,"what can i say about this class and prof. Bauman, it was simply an excellent experience. She is one THE BEST teachers out there. She loves the course and makes u love it too. I knew nothing about art, but definitely learned alot from her class. Excellent and clear lectures...tells exactly what she wants....easy exams...Overall EXCELLENT teacher!"
3294,good,"She can sometimes be obnoxious and rude but if you can get over that she is a very good accounting teacher. The class is structured very well and while you have to study a lot and keep up with the work every week to get an A, she does just about everything to make it easier to learn the material."
3251,poor,You might only need to attend her lecture before the tests because she will let you know what will be in the tests as well as taking attendence. Read the textbook and you will be fine.
4059,average,He is mean and it is just unnecessary.
4393,poor,Take someone else for this course. He rambles a lot and lectures get confusing. He says that the exams are from what is taught in class but that is completely false. I went to every lecture and read in the book and I still got a C in the class.
3908,good,"Professor Bauman is amazing! She is so excited about what she teaches and it makes you excited to learn. Attendance is taken sporadically, but you never know which day so skip at your own risk! Definitely very helpful & has a great sense of humor! Take her class!!"
1781,poor,"dont bother with class, just do the owls"
2569,good,"Reading from the past comments from a few years ago, she's improved. Now she interacts a lot more with students. Inside and outside the class. More friend and more helpful. Definitely get to know her, great person and great prof! Tests aren't so hard, but they're fair."
1785,average,"I honestly don't think I have ever learned less in a class. She tells long stories and shows complicated graph and goes over the important info very briefly. To do the HW you need to go to every class and there are weekly group presentations. If you go though I found it to be a pretty easy A, I would have preferred to learn something though"
2070,good,No Comments
356,average,"Molumby is good professor, he is funny in luctuer. His exam were completely tuff. you really need to study hard. als TA Jenny M. Zambrano is tuff in grading. she grades students very hard, and she does not know how to speak english very well. honestly she is horrible. Avoid this Facking Ta at any cost. She got some issues with her students."
4296,average,Overall really easy class. Gives test and quizzes that are completely based off the textbook. Lectures weren't really helpful but he's a really nice guy with a nice sense of humor. 
3325,poor,She will &quot;try&quot; to fail you rather than teaching the subject matter.Just ask the students who took her previously. More than 50% will have to repeat the class as you need at least C to be in the ACCT major. the irony is she is too incompetent to be a student in this class.. let alone teach..sigh..SO Don't mess up your ACCT GPA!! I WARNED YOU HERE!!!
1312,good,"This teacher was the most entertaining here my freshman year at UMASS. She drops two online quizzes and the lowest exam grade + extra credit. One book is just needed for a code, don't bring cell-phones to class or you will get ripped apart, but overall incredibly entertaining I haven't missed one class yet!"
1635,good,Easiest math course @umass. Literally a sad excuse for calc II. MUST GO TO CLASS! All problems done in class are on the test. Tests are NOT based on wileys. If you understand everything he does in class you will get an A. He literally told us which ones were on the test. One of our tests was the practice exam. IMO good at teaching the material.
550,average,Nice lady but has no business teaching Philosophy.  Reads off a note card and seems to have trouble answering arbitrary but relavent questions considering her lecture material.  Became hard to sit in class.  Pathetic is a better word for it.
2388,good,"The best teacher I have ever had. Very engaging, helpful, and just overall an amazing person. Love him. He's hot too."
2479,average,i love him!
2521,poor,really nice but not chem quality!
2265,good,"Outstanding, intelligent Prof.  Best first-year course. No regrets."
2959,poor,where did they get this clown&#63;
1227,good,Excellent Educator
452,poor,"Horrible teaching! I used to have 4.0 GPA. He makes funny faces and speaks sarcastically about everything, especially about religious people.  You have to write at the speed of light to copy down everything from the slide shows, because it will be on the tests. His test questions are very confusing. He does not count an answer with a misspelling.  "
3059,average,"Although did do this cool Snape-impersonation thing at the beginning of Chem 36 last year, he's annoying."
957,good,He's an incredible professor. Super nice and inspirational! I definitely recommend.
1773,good,he was the best calc teacher ever
2141,good,good! Repeats arguments and supports twice which is extremely helpful(if you're a slow typer/writer like me) Engaging. High textbook use which i see as a good thing because I don't want to waste my hard earned money especially when I only make minimum wage.
1008,average,"He's a funny and relatable guy, but as a general bio class, it is too difficult (and I took AP bio and got credit, and tend to think i know a lot about biology). He does not teach by the book, you won't even need it. He also focuses too much on cellular pathways and your ability to solve riddle-like questions, which doesn't actually test knowledge."
3118,poor,LIED to the class and had horrible make up exam policies.
1092,poor,"aweful, terrible professor"
4162,poor,Took online which was super easy.did homework every week and 1 discussion post for attendence.couple group assignments and the recitation teacher graded them extremely hard. tests all short answer and timed online. Never studied and used my book for tests. As long as you can search for the answers quickly then you will be fine on time.
3356,poor,"Assumes you already know what she is &quot;teaching.&quot;  Gives assignments out with no real practice or examples, just expects you to complete them with no knowledge of how to do so.  Test was extremely hard and her curve brought the average up to a whopping D!  This class doesnt need to be so hard."
2744,good,"If you can't pay attention to his lectures, you shouldn't be in life. sci."
4290,good,"Nice, personable, funny guy, obviously very knowledgeable and passionate about his subject. Exams and quizzes are all multiple choice, but some of the questions are poorly phrased and will make you lose points even though you know the material. There is some stuff in lectures that you need to know that's not in the book."
996,average,Randy is an good person but no the best professor. Much too difficult...
3506,good,"Fondufe is a passionate speaker and easy to understand. Her voice will annoy the crap out of you though! Exams are hard, mainly because there's a ton of info. Two exams before the final and each consist 5 to 6 chapters worth of info. Final was cumulative which sucked! Do the online hw! Slides are on bb so you can miss lecture on Fridays!"
1679,poor,"Thurlow is the bomb. Unfortunately he is a terrible teacher. He means well and loves the subject, but he lectures in class about things not on the test and he just about never spends time on actual material. He also has no clue how to use anything made in my lifetime."
153,poor,"Honestly take another professor, he isn't the nicest of professors t time either. Only positive is the grading scale is really easy. like a 73.5% is a B"
3147,poor,"The material isn't difficult; I knew it all and aced most of the exams.  At times he asks ridiculous questions, though, and is very unwilling to reward those who actually know the material.  Note: I knew the material b/c I read the book; he doesn't teach."
4034,good,"He is intelligent and knows what he is talking about. His expectations are clear and his teaching methods keep the class interesting. Take him if you want to work a little and have a good understanding of security. Oh, and don't buy the book at all."
2294,poor,No Comments
2908,good,No longer a bird course. Class average is 64 for midterm1 and 63 for midterm2. Median grade around 63-64 for both. The avg grade should have been higher for midterm2 supposing that those who failed have dropped the course but it was not the case. (This is not a comment by a non-studious person.)
2837,poor,"prof was hard, unclear, confusing..."
580,good,Excellent Prof!!
1470,poor,"One of the most arrogant, oblivious teachers I have ever known. He wrote a paragraph long example in WORDS then erased it 1 minute after. We all look at eachother everyday and LAUGH at this teacher to how bad he is. A student did not know how to integrate term by term and he says,&quot; Why couldn't you just do that&#63;!&quot; in fron of a class of 50. Bad guy."
703,poor,"do not take! this lady is CRAZY! very unorganized, always off topic-not in a good way where it gets you out of the boring lesson but in a way where she still thinks she taught what you need to know for her impossible midterm while talking about her patients problems. very personable, wants to know everyone, but try someone else for this course."
1212,good,very knowledgeable and interesting. Has a good sense of humor and good at keeping his students attention.
3343,poor,"By far the worst professor I've ever had...if you have a question don't even bother asking, if you have a problem don't bother telling her; SHE DOESN'T CARE!! also her teaching style is horrible and she is very ignorant, I'm a straight A student but getting a B in her class wasn't so bad  considering I'll never have to put up with her again."
896,poor,the class is multiple choice but he just wants to teach it and get out
3956,good,"Prof Bauman is one of the best at Mason. Not only did I learn so much about art history, I also learned that school is not just about getting grades. There is so much more to it than that. I ended up with an A- in her class, but I learned so much from her that I didn't learn from anyone else during all my years in school."
3308,poor,"Bad teacher goes to fast, doesnt explain material clearly, and doesn't give anything to study for final just says study everything."
487,good,hes a pretty funny guy. if your gonna take him get ready to study your butt off if you want a B or higher. tests are usually on powerpoints and some deffinistions from the book. doesnt take roll
3672,good,"She is very thorough and really helps you understand the material, she's also really nice."
559,good,Very smart and lectures are really interesting.
1141,good,"very funny energic nice guy, go to class everyday or you will get lost next time you go to class, he knows how to teach and he make sure that you understand the material, his test is just true or false, sometimes it may be tricky but u just have to read it careful"
3709,good,"The material is not too difficult however the workload was crazy. You must go to lectures because she does in class assignments and top hats, the exams cover A LOT of material and the study guides for them were SO LONG! Also lab required a lot of busy work, papers. Not an easy A, be prepared to work!"
1119,poor,"Classes are rushed.  He is often not prepared for class.  He makes frequent mistakes.  His written English needs improvement.  I do not find his teaching style to be very effective for me, which is a rarity.  I have e-mailed him several times and never received a response.  He doesn't keep the class quite.  I would not take another of his classes."
2849,poor,"I guess many comments containing the F word have been taken away. LOL. This prof is horrible, not organized and has absolutely so intention to teach. The course is as useful as this, memorize 1000 numbers and he'll ask u what's the 185th number&#63; LOL."
3822,poor,very nice lady but poor poor class.  you wont attend after a week because its so boring.  tests unusually hard.  avoid this class.
512,good,excellent teacher
633,good,"This class is not easy as an 8 week class, but if you follow JE's outline you can do all the work during the week and have weekends off. Also, if you need extra help you can make an appointment to receive help.  He does grade harsh, but it is fair.  Take the time to do the work and you will do well.  Trust me; English is NOT my strong suit."
4076,good,"You will learn, and you will learn a lot! He may scare you at first but he is actually a real nice person (just don't ask stupid questions). Quizzes were hard, but they won't affect your grade much (unless he changes it next semester). Homework was helpful and they were fun to do. Be specific on short answer questions on the test!"
1664,poor,"I've never had a problem with math until this class. Cook has the unique ability to make you confused about things you understood prior to the class. Very nice professor, he means well and tries to crack jokes to keep students entertained, but he just cannot teach. The homework problems are NOTHING like ones on the exams."
1012,good,"Randy is my favorite professor this semester. I have never really understood or liked bio until his class. He is funny, his lectures are pretty interesting. The material and quizzes and tests can be hard but if you go to review and SI sessions you will be fine. Definitely recommend taking, he is a great guy. "
1931,good,"fun and easy class, tried hard to make things interesting"
3464,good,This isn't an easy class. You need to work really hard in order to do extremely well because your grades are heavily on the exams. Make sure you study her powerpoint slides throughly daily so that you don't stress yourself a day or two before each exam.
1150,poor,"This man is plauge upon the university. He fails to make coherent statements in class, and calls upon his 10 favorite students everyday, even though they never have anything of value to say. p.s. &quot;Squigley things&quot; is not the proper term for DNA. If you want to continue with Bio, make sure that this man is not your teacher; he will ruin it for you."
2838,poor,"Terrible professor, mean and couldn't teach even if his life depended on it"
4263,good,The best professor at Mason.  She is very helpful and explains things very clearly.  Take her! she is the best.
116,good,Mehran is the rockin-est CS prof since Stuart Regis!
3545,good,Dr. Fondue is definitely excited and enthusiastic about her teaching. Be sure to check the MasteringBiology website for homework as it is not on the syllabus nor announced on blackboard. All PowerPoints are posted on BB as well as study guides for exams. She does use iClickers so remember to bring yours!
740,poor,He's all over the place in lectures and often does out long complicated problems on the board and only mentions when he's finished that it won't be on the test and he just wanted to show us where things come from. He doesn't explain what he's teaching--just scribbles on the board without explaining. Go to TA led review sessions--they will save you!
4229,average,"she got attitude problem. she is a hard grader too, the class is pretty clear, but if she could just change that attitude of her it will be better. by attitude, i mean, she acts and talks to you like she is always right, when you ask for help, she makes faces...but hey my A+ is all that mattered to me...peace."
1974,good,"Judith is adorable! She brings in food to our class every day since we only meet once a week. She is a fair grader and the class requires little outside work. There is one project on a disease of your choice. She keeps things interesting. Overall, very good and interesting class!"
1081,average,He asks many questions in class on PRS and you will never know if your PRS worked or how much the PRS is worth for grading. He does weekly quizzes in a rush and never gives the grades back or posts on sparkbut they are worth a large portion of your grade.In addition he wastes class time and gives no outside reading material to help prepare for clas
3675,good,"GREAT TEACHER!!! Come to class and study the book--you'll do great on the tests (there's 4 tests). She gives an answer key to the tests, so make sure you mark your answer on the sheet so you can study for the final.  She only tests on what is covered in class.  Fondufe understands material very well"
1810,good,"One of the best professors I've had. She makes class very enjoyable with videos, inter activities, and class demonstrations and has a ton of energy. She gives you fill- in- the blank lecture notes and homework is online. You will get an A if you do all of the homework. Great class!"
830,good,"the guy is the math teacher on campus. good teacher and explains things thoroughly, but he is hard to track down for office hours.  the people who complain about his teaching are only the people that have problems with math and failed the course.  he makes it relatively eay to get a good grade if you ar willing to work for it (but not teach urself)"
119,good,"Mehran is an excellent teacher, and his problem sets are designed to retain knowledge."
656,good,He was an good professor! I was transformed from student dreading COMP in to an A student in both of his I and II classes. He was challenging but I learned a lot and I really appriciate the effort he put in to his students. He has been my favorite professor. C:
4204,poor,"Whoever said Professor Wolf is lazy is right..all she knows how to do is give you bad grades. I spent all night studying for the exam and it wasnt hard, found out I got a bad grade..I think she changes your answers so you can fail her exams, cause they are NOT hard at all, but somehow everyone is failing them....(&#63;)"
4173,good,"Fabulous teacher, wonderful lady, extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. This class is super easy, the only problem is they do not give + or -. So I was just a few points away from A and could not get A- or B+, that was hard for me to adjust. Other than that, very easy class, straightforward and crystal clear presentations - very enjoyable."
1129,good,"he is a great professor.. you must go to class to get a good grade, does not teach by the book. PRS every class and quiz every friday in class, study for the exams with PRS posted online and notes, book does not help, you do not even need it really."
635,good,"If you work hard, read all the material, pay attention and take notes during class, and see him during office hours when you need help, you will do well.  He said all semester that most students who struggle in his class don't do most of the above.  How is that his fault?  If you're too lazy and/or too busy to do all of the above, don't blame him."
369,good,"Great professor, explains things very clearly, even better than his lecture notes. If you don't go to lecture, you lose out. Yes, he asks random questions from the textbook on exams, but he gives obvious hints about them in lecture. His tests are hard, but if you've gone to lecture and done all the problems he recommended, you'll be fine."
268,poor,Goes off tangents. a lot. exams are hard. not helpful at all. dont take him
2703,good,I think Mckay is an aquired taste. He knows his stuff reallyyyy well aka he's been teaching for a while. but he still gets excited and I gotta say when he does it really sparks up the class... he's different in many ways but we definitely don't get that kind of speech just anywhere. So yea I like this prof.
3891,good,"Good teacher, makes a required class fun and interesting. Intimidating on the first day, however is easy with grading on papers and tests are generally easy if you study."
2983,good,"One of the best professors I've ever had.  His tests are bit hard, but if you study well, you can do well in his course."
2870,good,"I really loved and enjoyed SOC102 with Dr. Tepperman. He made the material relatable to everyday life. The material is very heavy as there are two textbooks for this course (both written by him). He is very approachable in office hours, just by going to office hours once he gave me a research opportunity in sociology."
2914,good,"He was good but scattered lectures. He makes good jokes, tests were easy and classes were not boring. Not the best but certainly above average."
46,good,"Mehran is good. He is always fun to listen to and he explains everything so well. The lectures are also filmed and uploaded on the course website (same day) so you ""go to lecture"" on your own time (at double speed).  He is very approachable and loves what he teaches."
3421,poor,"TOO quick and a bit frightening, esp. when she jumps off the stage to chase her students who try to leave early! haha. but yea she is hard."
4241,poor,"She is like a Preying Mantis. Run while you can... Otherwise, she will bite your head (grade) off."
991,good,"Randy really is good. If you're taking Bio 151 just to fill a requirement and don't actually care about learning the material, maybe skip taking it with Randy. If you are really interested in the material, though, he's great. It's different from any bio class you'll take because its all application but it's so worth it and truly prepares you!"
876,poor,No Comments
4,good,"Honestly just read the material I know had I done that I would have done a lot better. She does not expect that much from you and if you are interested in poly sci you will enjoy her take on things. Prepare for the quizes, they are at random."
3051,poor,Moylan is extremely high on himself and was didn't seem to care at all about the students in this class.
3124,good,assesments are HARD
2660,average,"great lecturer, but seems not to care about students when they have difficulties."
2491,average,brownin i love u!!!
3854,good,"This is the most hardest class I ever took in my life. Geesh for a 100 level I felt as if it was a 300 or 400 level. Her test are so HARD!!! My goodness, there is so much memorization, get ready to study. I would suggest you take someone else. There are two test and a group project and field trip project. She doesn't post her notes on blackboard."
1715,good,he da best
1148,good,Great teacher. Has a love for bio. Cares about his students succeeding. Many review sessions and SI sessions available. Some quizzes are hard but he will freebie it if many people did badly. Three lowest quiz grades dropped. Talent night during review for an additional quiz grade dropped. Fair exams but final was hard IMO. TAs grade very harshly.
3261,poor,"Consistently, one of the worst rated professors in the GMU accounting department."
574,good,Knows his stuff and makes you too.  Runs a hard course.
3769,average,"This class is cake. It is possible to NOT get an A though, because as of Fall 09 she started doing iclicker questions. If you do want to get an A do as follows: go to class at least once a week (same day as lab), night before an exam go through ppt slides and fill out study-guides, do some extra credit if you think you need it. take Kwame for lab!"
3736,good,She is very nice and the class is very easy!
853,poor,"Don't take this teacher if you don't understand math. He is n help, so if you can't teach yourself you WILL fail"
1982,average,"First of all she is probably one of the nicest professors and makes the material she lectures interesting enough with fun activities. However her exams are disorganized and sometimes worded awkwardly/unclear. After the exam she posts the keys but there's usually 1 or 2 or 4 mistakes, which causes great anxiety for horrible test takers like me."
2774,poor,bad memories of psl 302
1166,average,"The class was very interesting, but he tends to go off on tangents, which is good, but he does it a lot. He would be very helpul, except he makes way too much &quot;extra&quot; material that's supposed to help and you get confused with what's important and what you can do without. overall, very good prof."
971,good,Best professor I have ever had. Genuinely cares about students and knew all of our names within the first two weeks of class. Learn a lot of relevant things for the business world but have fun while doing it. Excellent feedback on resumes and papers. Take jr year writing with him.
2701,good,"He's a wonderful prof, actually goes through and explains with detail what the meaning of each slide is and what the specific diagrams are. Doesn't read over the slides like most profs do in university. Tests are also pretty basic knowledge that you should get if you go to lecture and look over the slides. Fantastic overall."
3847,good,"Strict teacher, the two exams are so hard. I put lots of effort, however, I got an A-. The textbook is not mandatory, just come to class and take notes. The field trip and design studio are interesting. If you want to fulfill your fine art requirement, I will recommend you take the DANCE125!!!"
2368,good,"Great prof, super clear, easy going, really helpful. Pretty much made me want to wake up and commute an hour to get to the 9am class"
4115,poor,This guy actually wants you to fail.  Avoid him like the plague
2950,good,One of the best profs i've had. You read an article that you think is really uninteresting and he talks about it in class and brings it to life making you understand it in a whole new way. Sooo helpful. Really wants you to succeed. Takes a genuine interest in his students. Such a great guy. Clearly loves what he does and this passion is contagious.
524,poor,tests r crazy
2455,average,"although very funny, he did not fully explained things clearly. should have given more examples in class"
1841,good,Great class! 3 exams and an optional final. HW is easy and helps out the grade alot as well. Great class to take as an elective for psych majors.
537,good,"The class is ok, she takes it very serious.  Quiz everyday and attendance is important.  Two 8 pages papers make up most of your final grade."
2806,poor,"Dont take his course.  He is the worst professor in the world. Teaches useless stuff.  Unfair grading policy, difficult tests"
3175,good,"1st exam  95, 2nd exam 87, 3rd exam 74, final exam, 55, Connects hw and quizzes 8. Final exam was excessively difficult. Do not take her if you don't have enough time to study literally by yourself."
784,good,People are so bad at math. Thurlow is a decent teacher and so funny
4057,poor,Sweet mother of God is this man over his head. He has no idea how to instruct a course properly. He is a bad lecturer and an even worse person. As others have said he is demeaning to students and overall rude. He is uninformed on the subject matter and lacks proper interactive skills a professor needs to be successful. Avoid at all costs.
1409,good,she is very funny and class is interesting
2537,good,amazing prof.
154,poor,"Probably one of the worst Bio instructors I've had. Attending lectures is pointless as I didn't learn a single thing from listening to his rambling. The book is useless. For tests, he expects you to know every single example on his 200+ slides. Only way to ""study"" is memorize the answers to the previous exams and hope they actually show up on tests"
3009,good,One of the best profs at U of T. He really cares about his students. If you work hard you can easily get over 80 in this course because it is not difficult to understand and Dr. AbouHaidar makes it very interesting making you want to learn more. People with neg feedback are bitter because they tried to bs the exam and it backfired on them.
1686,good,"Okay, here's the deal with Cook.  His class seems harder than it is because he goes on long rants about how to derive equations.  You DO NOT need to understand exactly how to do this, all you need to write down is the final equation that he derives, and understand when to use it.  If you memorize and understand these few equations, then tests are s"
2901,poor,All of his lectures are really common sense. I don't understand why he creates his tests so confusing eventhough stuffs he knows truly lacks novelty...
4352,average,"He's a really sweet guy.  Pretty boring, but worth going to class.  No papers or homework, fairly easy tests, make sure you check his math though!"
3863,good,She's a great professor. Took her in the morning and it was easy to pay attention in class because she's hilarious. Make sure you read through the textbook because she gives out pop quizzes from the book. 
2733,poor,BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG!
1895,good,"She's not a bad professor, per se, but she's simply not a very interesting person. If you're a frat boy/sorority girl, she is the professor for you. She's conventional in her attitude and the work won't challenge you at all."
569,average,"He isn't a bad teacher, but he needs more expression in his voice! He helps out students during lab time which is nice!"
1816,good,"she was great - easy homework (and not much of it) and her exams were really straight forward. easy A, and interesting too."
2065,good,Goodenough is very clear and precise about the material and presents it in an interesting way. She's lenient and willing to help you out. Tests are easy if you come to lecture and study the notes she gives out.
127,good,"Alexander used a free &quot;book&quot; which you could pretty much study and not have to go to class. But, he always had interesting stories and kept class pretty interesting. Tests were not very hard, very few homeworks, and attendance was not required."
3394,good,Great Professor! She is a smart woman who really knows what she is talking about.  She is someone that I really admire in the Accouting Department.  If you have any questions she or your lab instructor are always there for help.
3327,poor,"poor. Doesn't help, isn't interested, doesn't have clear understanding of subject matter. Condescending, spiteful, lazy. The plus side: ends class usually an hour early, no doubt because glossing over ppt slides she doesn't understand has come to an end."
4386,poor,"run as fast as you can in the other direction. his lectures have nothing to do with the tests, but then again neither do his study guides."
2975,good,"people confuse his great personality with his ability to teach. ""Flies"" through 40 slides in less than 2 minutes with minimum description.  great person to have around to present as a guest lecturer, not so much if you who is actually able to teach you something  "
980,good,Randy is a great professor who really cares about his students. He will do everything in his power to make sure you succeed. YOU MUST ATTEND LECTURE. Seriously if you just look at his slides and don't attend lecture all you'll find is a bunch of pictures  that make absolutely no sense. Study for Friday quizzes and exams a lot and you'll get the A.
2300,good,JAR OF PEPPERS!
190,good,Molumby is a super cool dude who can be intimidating at first. He's super funny in class and when you go into office hours he's more than happy to have you. Usually the question you ask ends up on the exam so it's a bonus. Practice exams are online and super helpful. Taking AP Bio before this class also makes it very easy to understand.
1139,good,"Great Teacher. He focuses more on concept than memorization he's a great guy, really wants us to learn. Reading the book will greatly increase ur level of understanding of the material but if u go to class and review sessions you should still do well. Material is somewhat confusing but he tries to explain until u get it."
699,good,"Dr. Sacher is a sweet professor, very understanding.  Although there is much work to be done for this research class she does her best to guide you thru the entire process.  I dont have my grade yet, but I'm pleased with her class you learn alot. There is a large paper due but it is done with a group.  Make sure you choose your group member wisely."
4205,average,"She is limited to her slides and stupid movie clips.  Ever hear of doing actual examples, maybe have practice quizzes in class.  She is just lazy... I got a B and it was ok... But I think her teaching sucks as does she."
606,average,His classes should be labeled for English majors. Papers are graded harshly. Even more so if it strays from his interpretation of the writings. Listen to everything thing he says about a story or poem so you can essential reword it if you hope to get top marks.
301,good,"good teacher. Reuses tests, so STUDY the old ones that are online. Definitely keeps your interest, pretty funny guy. Plus, he's got a sweet beard."
3420,good,"Ever1 told me not to take her bc she's hard, but it's not true. It all depends on your study habits. She moves very quickly bc she's from NY :) but if you sit up front and pay attention, you will understand the material and learn to love it. She's challenging!"
4242,good,"She is a great professor, but the class content is blatantly obvious BS!  No problem with her, but more the SOM for making us take this class... Example of course content: when you are mad, you might take it out on other people...DUH    Motivated people are better employees... DUH    People dont like to be looked down upon... DUH"
1060,poor,Prof Phillis is a good teacher if you already have a strong background in biology. His tests are very difficult and the discussion sections almost useless. There is no way to know how you are doing in the class until the very end. I hear SI sections are helpful. the only real plus side to this class is that there is no homework
2565,good,good teacher
4394,poor,"he likes to blabber about random things and then chuckle at his own jokes. Seems like a nice guy, but doesnt do a good job of staying on task with his teaching. He is often late and always has problems with the microphone. His tests are badly worded."
1069,good,A great professor that gives interesting lectures and prepares you well for exams. You have to go to class due to clicker questions (although since his lectures are interesting this shouldn't be an issue) His tests are somewhat hard but go to SI sessions and you should be fine. Don't bother buying the textbook as its never used. Better than others.
2524,good,Funny.  Intelligent.  Cute.  Great teacher.  What more can you ask for&#63;
2205,good,Very hard course
1243,good,She makes this class so entertaining. Tammy is a funny lady and her class is easy. Tests posed more of a challenge than you's think but she drops the lowest one. Just a fun class to go to and interesting things to learn about. Probably the best gen ed class I've taken in my 3 years here.
16,poor,I question her neutrality
3120,average,this guy is hard...i dont know why he makes his exam retakes impossible since your maximum grade on the retakes are capped.
815,average,"He jumps into examples and never tells us how he got there. some things he teaches in class arent in the book so theres no way to study some of it, and before the final he tries to teach us new stuff whispering all throughout (cold) and there was 2 pages of that on the exam. i am premed, and because of his work, i am now at a major disadvantage."
3067,poor,Just don't ever take a class from this man if you can avoid it.  Do yourself a favor.
959,good,"Michael is one of my best friends. He takes the time to get to know you, mainly through knowing your resume, and will give you feedback based on your aspirations. Is incredibly cultured and knowledgeable on everything. Highly recommend talking to him in office hours just because of how great of a guy he is."
225,good,"I thought Molumby was a great professor. Unlike many professors, he managed to hold my attention during lectures. My only issue was that his exams covered stupid details from lectures instead of major topics. It was like he was testing us on our attendance instead of our understanding of the topic. He gives a great curve at the end!"
3354,poor,WORST PROFESSOR IN THE WORLD!!!!  Avoid her AT ALL COSTS. Enough said.
2485,good,"browning is the hottest piece of ass to walk into lash miller. on a side note, his lectures weren't bad either. i like the way he sips his water, puts his hands through his hair and the unintentional sexual innuendos placed everywhere."
562,poor,"constant mistakes makes it hard to follow him, high school methods i dont even remember seem to work better than he technical mumbo jumbo ways of solving should be simple problems."
3436,poor,"Horrendous teacher, is too busy yelling/chasing people for walking out of class (not what I paid for), and clucks/pecks like a chicken when she talks.  I'm getting a B, and have worked way too hard for it. If you can, AVOID AVOID AVOID, you will hate ACCT after her."
1693,good,"The courses he teaches are the easiest calcs offered at UMass. If you don't do well on his course, even if you were without an instructor, you are a god damn shame. This course is a high school-repeat. Cook's understanding in Math is very profound. He's humble and also a great resource. I would highly question the work ethic of those who complain."
1045,good,"People who complain about the difficulty of the course just need to put in more work. He's an extremely helpful, friendly professor who is deeply passionate about the material, so of course he wants to go into detail. It doesn't hurt that he has a great sense of humor too, it really brightens up the class."
3446,good,"She is a great teacher, However accounting is a hard subject so you have to study a lot to do well. I am taking her again for account 301 beacuse I think she is an good teacher"
954,good,She is an good teacher.Very funny and keeps the class entertaining. TAKE HER I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.
2735,poor,No Comments
4314,poor,"He is a very nice man, but his lectures are very scattered.  The material we go over is useless. He always uses poweroints and he swiftly goes through the slides so no one can copy the notes."
1218,good,No Comments
1527,poor,"Terrible teacher, extremely boring...he writes down EVERY word he says in paragraph form.  Doesn't show many examples and doesn't explain things well at all.  I took AP Calc in highschool and I still didnt understand the way he taught the material...unless you have taken Calc before, you're basically screwed in his class."
3987,good,I thought Art History was going to suck but Professor Baumen was good!  I have never skipped a class and I rarely find myself daydreaming. She makes the class interesting. The Papers are easy if you go to lectures and midterm and final are not that hard if you study.
1300,good,The best professor that Ive had. Her class is extremely entertaining and she is really helpful. 4 tests which arent terribly hard and you get to drop one of them. No final. Quizzes are all online so you can do them with a group. Her lectures are really fun and entertaining. She gives pop writings but they arent hard as long as you read
160,poor,"The second exam was, for the most part, supposed to be based on genetics and evolution. Please tell me why my version of the exam was about 5% genetics and 95% information related to very specific information from exam 1 information. I understand that we should know exam 1 info, but I literally just studied your 1000 ppt slides for nothing..."
4067,good,Prof. Lyons is the ONLY teacher at Mason that I ever really learned anything from. Yes he is abrasive and hard to approach but his lectures are interesting and jokes are funny. He grades tough and hates stupid questions but that is only because he actually expects you to put some effort into the course. If you take that initiative you will do fine.
956,good,"Professor Schurter is probably the best teacher I have had at UMass. He really gets his student's business writing materials in great working order for the real world. He also educates his students on how to be good people. Wish i could take this class over again. Class is mandatory, no textbook needed."
3791,poor,"Absent from class for nearly two months. Learned a lot, but on my own initiative. Takes weeks to respond to questions and grade assignments. Prescribes thousands of pages of reading in total: two textbooks, online modules, online reserved readings, and Web material. Combined with homework, it is entirely too much work in this class."
3234,average,"Hard class in general but if you read the text book and do the homework you will get an A. She tells you exactly what will be on it. I never went to recitation but I did the connect homework and got an A. Never had above an 86 on my tests and got an 89 on the final. Ended up with an A, will push up your grade if she sees that you tried on the final"
2869,good,you have to read lots to get good marks!
3777,good,very nice and helpful! just love this class :)
2961,good,Soc 101ers have Prof Tepperman wrong. He is a wonderful and smart prof.
2200,average,worst prof ever and extremley dry. He acts very cocky and he has no time for any questions or extra help.
98,good,Very cool
2557,good,Great lecturer! Although he has some weird obsession with eigenfunctions...
3183,good,"This class consisted of 4 exams, 3 tests worth total 60 percent of your grade, and 1 final worth 30 percent, last 10 percent come from your connect hw and quizzes. The professor was not really helpful, mostly I studied by watching online videos. The final was the hardest, other 3 tests was ok, most questions came from connect hw and quizzes."
253,average,He tends to go off on tangents and not fully cover the material. The labs are mind numbing but nothing too bad. The tests are hard. Even after reading and trying to memorize literally hundreds of slides it still feels like he uses questions from the top of his head and not actual material. Good guy but overall a bad teacher.
3923,good,"This is a hard class! dont think its an easy A, at all!! I found her to be interesting, but the exams are no joke. Go to every class, and write down everything. I mean everything. If you like art, you will enjoy, if not, look else where. She is tough."
1445,poor,Can't teach at all!
1648,poor,Hard teacher. Blame the department for the hard tests but practice tests are nothing like the real ones. Class is so boring i've might lost attention numerous times every class. Nothing came clear to me any classes. AVOID HIM
3991,good,"Lyons gets a bad rap but I thought his 366 course was enjoyable. He provides very detailed lectures (sometimes too detailed) but if you pay attention you will learn the material. The exams are more difficult than the study guides entail, but if you take notes during the lecture on what he talks about in relation to the topics, you'll be okay."
1696,poor,"He goes off in tangents.  He never solved problems completely out and he'd derive some equations and confuse you so much.  The lectures, OWLs, won't prepare you for the test. I got more help at the tutoring places than going to lecture all semester. But he's a nice guy though."
3191,poor,"Took her for an internship summer course.  No grading criteria, expectations or rubric whatsoever -- no explanation for the grade until everything is submitted.  Her research paper had 2 sentences of vague instructions and expectations.  Did not know what she wanted in the assignment.  Not helpful on email at all.  DO NOT TAKE!!!"
1154,good,"He is enthusiastic and shows that he loves what he does. He asks vague questions in class to get discussions going.  He might not be very clear in class with everything, but he offers study sessions every Thursday, and then adds Tuesdays when it gets closer to the Final. He gives you every opportunity to understand the material and ask questions."
2255,good,Professor Brym makes my day!!!!!!!!!
1682,poor,"A nice guy, but a blah professor."
3170,good,"Prof. Hylton isn't as bad as everyone says she is. If you ask her questions she helps you and responds quick to emails. Attendance is not required but she tells you what to study in class for the exams except the Final is quit tough. As long as you attend class, do the connect homework and quizzes and practice them a lot for the exams you'll pass."
2056,good,She is amazing at answering questions and emails! utilize her intelligence and helpfulness. also makes some hilarious jokes in class... definately go!
4090,poor,He stole Christmas.
3108,good,"He's a great professor and is really enthusiastic about the course.  It's useful to stay for lectures because of the quizzes (easy 3 pts) and you get to learn a lot too.  Once he chased someone who left the lecture right after the quiz, so I guess he's pretty funny.  His exams get progressively harder but he curved the final so it was all good."
3723,average,"Lectures are boring and participation is graded with ""Top Hat."" Attendance not necessarily needed. Tests are alright. She reads off the ppt's, all ppt's are on blackboard. The lab was always ahead of lectures which was annoying. Extra credit available. Just review ppt's and find her old tests. Not a lot of work to get a good grade!"
2049,good,"easy class, interesting, very understandable"
3643,average,No Comments
4333,poor,He is actually a terrible prof. All of the graded things were online and so NOBODY went to the lectures and so he added in class exams. His lectures are on NOTHING. He talks about his life and nothing pertaining to Sociology. If he continues with online tests I would actually recommend getting Dennis so you don't have to go to lecture.
623,good,I would not suggest this to students are not willing to put in time and effort. He will offer as much help as you are willing to take. I was too shy to discuss in class and come meet with him about my grade and this truly pulled my grade down. Leaves plenty of feedback and you can tell he wants his students to succeed. 
262,average,"He is an alright professor, mandatory to go to class because he uses an I- clicker. He tends to ramble a lot and his tests are a bit difficult. But he can be very helpful if you go to his office hours, overall it is an interesting class with alot of information and reading is required. It is an easy B but you really got to work hard to get that A."
3369,poor,A terrible professor!! she doesn't care about students AT ALL she has no heart and annoying voice. AVOID AT ALL COSTS
4061,good,"He is one of the best professors I had; this doesn't mean he is easy... but he is full of knowledge. I took him on IT 223 and even though it was hard and painful... I actually learn a lot with him, so I enrolled this semester in IT366. He is full of knowledge.if you want an easy &quot;A&quot; think twice taking him because you would really need to work hard."
1802,good,"Loves to teach...sometimes a little bit too much to handle at 9am. Definitely wants her students to do well, as long as effort is put in. I would strongly reccomend going to class because test questions often involve details from in class videos. Reading the book is also helpful. Go to discussion groups too because you earn 20 bonus points!"
4392,poor,"don't take him.  he's a real nice guy, i think i might like him outside the classroom, but his lectures are unhelpful, tests difficult.  i had to learn out of the book, even though i went to class.  he could work on the lectures"
2385,average,Good Luck on the Test.
1959,good,"I am not a science person but this class was amazing!  She is very funny, all lectures are online, and there are many opportunities to get extra credit.  Don't buy the textbook, the lectures and lecture notes are online.  I would definitely recommend taking this class!"
2976,good,The professor was one of the best at U of T St. George. A dedicated virologist with extensive knowledge. He also encouraged students to work hard for the future. He is those type of prof who really wants you to succeed in your life!
488,average,"Good teacher, very interesting.  Film clips and current events really break up the monotony of the usual class lectures.  Test are usually based on power points, but quizes are from book and very hard."
1843,good,This was an good class. Whitbourne did a great job at making a 9am class worth getting up and going to. It was a very easy class and with extra credit opportunities is almost impossible not to get an A in. It sparked my interest in psychology and I was only taking it as an elective. Definitely take this class.
1734,good,"The math isnt that hard, but the tests are fairly meticulous, but multiple choice! He is great guy, and will provide you with whatever help you need if you go to class.  a little confusing in class, and he has a habit of showing up late and letting the class leave anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes early every day."
2911,good,"The course was really interesting! Tepperman is a very engaging lecturer, and although his presentations are at times scattered, I listened the whole way through. I just wish there was another method of evaluation... An essay, and more tutorials perhaps."
3219,poor,"Professor Hylton is none too helpful or pleasant. Overall disrespect for students learning a completely new subject. The ""lectures"" are a joke, she just rewrites content out of the textbook. However, if you do the homework mindfully and diligently, and go to recitation you will pass."
146,good,"It depends of tA. T here aren't a lot of points and the hw, discussions, papers, labs are all graded by the tA and there is no rubric. I got a rough grader compared to my peers so I had to pull my weight in this intro level class. Some tests are difficult but you get an optional one at the end. I thought Moloumby was entertaining."
1986,good,"Great Professor, all information presented in class helped pass the tests without really having to study. Attending the lectures is vital to not having to study for hours on the material."
1369,good,She is the cutest professor EVER! Her hair bounces when she walks. And her twins are adorable. The class was really easy too.
2811,good,"This is NOT an easy course. But if people actually DO the suggested homework, they wouldn't have so much trouble in the course. You'll be fine if you put some EFFORT into the course. That's why you hear about people complaning this course is hard because they don't even bother to do the suggested homework at the least."
659,good,"Mr.Everett was the best he explained everything clearly, gave mulptiple examples, and gave students a outline on how to write the paper. All you have to do is follow the outline and you will get a decent grade. Mr. Everett also helps students if they as for it and his test as well as reading quizzes are simple if you study. Overall he was  great."
1794,average,"She's very nice and highly enthusiastic for a 9AM, but lacks clarity at some points. Some TAs aren't helpful either. Tests can be tricky, so come to every lecture (with printed notes!), do the textbook readings, and keep up with quizzes. 20pts extra credit for discussions is a plus. Get LearnSmart!!"
2511,good,"So cute you just wanna hug him!  Umm...chem is fun, eh&#63; ;)"
3397,average,"The class requires some work but nothing over the top. She knows her stuff (after all, she is a C.P.A) but she is not cut out to be a teacher. Classes are ok. Tests are easy, quizzes are mild. Study guide that comes with the book is much better help than any groups that you might form."
1147,good,"I adore him. He's a little arrogant, but heck if I was a professor of Biology and I wrote books about biochemical warfare, I would be too. I think he's very clear and teaches Bio the best way possible. Best bio teacher I've ever had. I'm gonna miss him! I wish he'll be my bio prof in the future! :)"
3272,poor,She is the worst teach. Talks/yells down to her students.  Her grading is very unfair and doesnt know what she is teaching half of the time.  If you want to pass DO NOT take this class with her.
608,poor,na
3582,poor,"As an earlier rater said, her class would be a headache. I don't know how some people managed to pay attention in her class! she's shouldn't be a professor in a 100 level class with 300 level expectation. I read some misleading rated comments and took her, and tht was a big mistake :("
1930,good,"makes class interesting, though you must go..."
197,good,"If you pay attention in lecture, discussion, and keep up with the assignments you'll pass no problem. Participation is in the form of i-Clicker. He moves pretty quickly through the lectures so be prepared. Read the book. READ THE BOOK. Sometimes he pulls test questions from the book. If you can keep up and ask for help, you're golden."
2931,poor,"Throughout my four years at U of T, I have never met a professor as demeaning and biased as Tepperman.  If he likes you, you're set (as another member wrote).  If not, you're screwed."
2327,average,ehhh
766,poor,"With respect to humanity, Cook is an extremely pleasant and grandpa-esque little man. I did enjoy his anecdotes and his comments. What I didn't enjoy, however, was his poor teaching. This class stressed me out beyond belief because I hadn't the slightest clue of what was going on. Avoid him if you can."
4218,poor,"The exams are extremely hard, not enough time to finish the exam. Most of the question she brings from every where, text book, lecture and lab. She thinks this is a graduate class. You think management is easy, wait till you take this class. Her exams are hardest exams ever I had. Good luck!!!"
3255,good,Not as bad of as professor as people make her out to be. I was nervous when I took her last semester but she turned out to be a great teacher. Simple rule: if you're confused go ask her and she is more than happy to help you learn.
202,poor,he looks like he is part of the sons of anarchy. first day of class I was shocked when I saw him. his exams are very hard and impossible to pass other than that just don't take him 
3510,good,"Fondufe is an amazing professor, her tests are directly from the powerpoints so no need to buy the book. Come to class, she likes to give i clicker quiz from time to time. Taking notes in class makes powerpoint more understandable and sometime there few questions on test from the lecture which aren't include on the powerpoint."
1733,average,extremely boring. I went to only 3 classes but still did fine.
2777,poor,He's a really poor prof....
1707,poor,"poor, poor teacher. He just puts random examples on the board, solves them himself and doesn't explain how or when to use the equation. Math was always fun and enjoyable for me until this guy. Very unhelpful. Doesn't look at emails. Just don't take 127 with him."
3474,poor,"The only way to do well in this class is to memorize EVERY single peice of information on the PowerPoints which are around 80-90 slides, and if you don't know everything on all three of them you will not get an A. I will not take her again because she refused to consider an 89.72 an A-... she will not be there for you at the end of the semester"
854,good,"He is really fare in person, but he is certainly out to get you on the exams.  If you email him and tell him you need a certain grade for your major he will reconsider you grade."
4097,poor,"Horrible professor!!! Do not take this class!! He wants to purposely ruin your life!!  He makes your entire semester misreble.  He is rude, evil and just a plain nasty person.  GMU needs to get rid of him as soon as possible!"
2160,good,"Good course, great professor."
698,good,"Dr. Sacher is one of the sweetest ladies, but this class was a drag.  She tries so hard to make it interesting, but it just not.  BUT it is a requirement so if u must take it, take it with her.  And i agree with the previous comment, DEFINATELY choose your group members wisely!!"
4350,good,"He tends to ramble in his lectures & students spent most of the class time talking about their(mildly relevant)lives/interests. Show up 2 classes before the tests, he gives study guides w/ all the questions on them.He's really nice and eager to work with you.As long as you show up enough for face recognition and do the study guides,you'll get an A."
2999,good,very entertaining and helpful. he wants everyone to do well.
3696,poor,"I learned nothing, the class was easy but it was almost not worth taking. I loved the Lab part but Largen is a poor lecturer, she goes off on tangents and doesn't cover much of the required material. But you are still going to be tested on it. The exams are long and middle school questions are phrased in college format, spelling errors everywhere."
1636,average,He's nice and funny but he's not great. He's better off teaching calc theory than basic calc. There are only 4 total grades - 3 exams and homework. You can redo homework a million times but Wiley is annoying. TAs were a lot more helpful. Go to reviews and SIs. He does not respond to email.
3457,good,"Very fair and gives you plenty of opportunities to pass, provided you are doing all of the work and reading and going to class."
3581,good,She is a really good teacher and is helpful! The nice thing about her is she puts the notes online so I never went to class except for the tests and quizzes.  As long as you do the study guides for the tests and go over it you will do fine on the tests.
1291,good,Love her
1853,poor,"She thinks too highly of herself and even though her class was easy to get an A in, she talked too much about herself and she puts on too much makeup."
3763,good,"She's the best! Don't buy the textbook, its completely not necessary. Just study the powerpoints and study guides (the answers to which are on her website). It's okay to miss a few i-clicker questions due to absences... and still get an A+"
3304,poor,"Prof. Hylton is without a doubt the most miserable professor in SOM.  Her TA's do all the actual teaching.  She talks way too fast, shows ZERO interest in students, doesn't reply to emails, and has a overall total lack of respect for others.  Unless you are one of the people who naturally understands accounting...AVOID her at all costs!"
4320,good,"He is a nice older man who sound a little like James Earl Jones.  He definitely knows the material and can very easily be understood.  His class is very easy, so long as you go, take notes, or read before exams.  There were no assignments other than your journal/notebook. He does ramble a little which can be boring, but I recommend him."
3743,good,"Pretty much like 110. Class isn't too tough. Lab is a lot of work and can be a pain, but it's not too tough. Her lectures can be interesting depending on the topic. She's such a nice person. Take her! Def the best way to get your lab requirement!"
3445,good,"Very helpful professor. Exams are hard though. You'll learn a lot, but you need to be prepared."
1998,good,Boring but easy. Gives alot of extra credit!!!
663,poor,"Not a very helpful professor, very frustrating class."
3748,good,"She is the sweetest, funniest, and most helpful science teacher that I had ever had! Recommend her if science is not your thing. Lab is not hard but time-consuming. The materials are basic of other sciences so it's not hard. Do the study guide and EC opportunities than you'll get an A!"
709,good,"BEST teacher i've ever had, dont take this class with anyone else! she's so genuine and loves all of her students. she accepts late assignments. regardless of what she says you're going to need to know the main terms from the book for the midterm and final, it'll help you out a lot."
1282,good,loved this class take 4 tests but she drops the lowest score and very easy 100 points from 10 question online quizzes that you can just google the answers to
2675,average,"nice prof..tests are too hard.. corny jokes, laughs at them herself.. oh yeh the voice has gotta go :("
4029,poor,"His lecture only consists of reading vocab definitions. He takes off points on mistakes on HW, but he has a lot of errors on his works and he doesn't even know it. He needs a makeover in his teaching style. He is very rude and unprofessional. Little does he know he can learn from students too. His lectures are good for nothing on the real job."
1306,good,"Tammy's class was a breeze for me. If you do the readings and take notes and study for tests you should do well. No writing needed, but multiples choice tests. Random mini-quizzes in class make it a good idea to go to them. Dropping lowest grades is allowed. Good glass and prof. overall."
2237,good,"soc101 is an enlightening course.  i feel i'm learning a lot of a relevent material in the course, and it's certainly changing my perspective on society.  i wish it would focus more on primary teachings, rather than sec., but it's still a good soc. intro"
3302,poor,"Hylton if you read this, get your TA's to respond to emails better because how can I get help if I never get my questions answered&#63;"
2038,good,She was a great professor and supplied good examples.  She really knew her stuff.  Answered a lot of questions and looked up the ones she didnt know.  Tests were easy if you went to class and reviewed the notes packet.  Easy A.
1529,poor,"No point in going to class. The way he writes notes, he should be an english teacher. He doesnt give notes like a math teacher should... its all in words and PAGES long. The only good thing is he lets u have cheat sheets for each exam and opens the owls before each exam too. But I would definately recommend taking it with another teacher."
1663,average,"He is extremely confusing but if you sit up front and persevre and ask questions you'll get the material and an A. Do the hw to boost your grade. ASK if you dont get it, he will definetely clarify."
4338,good,Very kind and funny professor. He is easy if you just do the readings and he gives a Study Guide with what will EXACTLY show up on the Test! Lectures can get boring but if you show up take notes and look over the study guide you can pass GAURANTEED. You dont need to read everything either just look at study guide! TAKE HIM! Nice & funny laugh too!
4356,poor,He was absolutely horrible! I was a sociology major and got a's in every other class and this is the only class i've failed
3627,average,Not a bad class. going to class will definitely be beneficial. sometimes hard to get help since it is a large lecture
2693,good,"Yes he's monotone  but its Life Sciences. No one is there to really entertain you. His exams are fair game. Yes he does go into way too much tedious detail then we'll need to, but medschool is all about memory work. This is good prep. If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen."
3060,poor,No Comments
1597,poor,No Comments
2729,poor,"Monotone, boring, and suggested readings are truely useless (it's his own freaken textbook and you can HEAR his monotone reading the text).  HORRIBLE!!!!!!"
2625,average,"Messed me up on the final, all previouse exams were multiple choice, suddenly that summer she decided to change it."
3157,average,"Grades based on tests mostly. Hard. HW each week on connect. Speaks fast. Do read chapters before class. Blunt (called the class ""just terrible""). Class activities somwhat helped. Work hard for your grade. No lectures or PPT posted to BB. Used BB to access homework and check grades mostly. Clear rubric, grading, and schedule. 1-2 chapters a week."
3314,good,I got a C in this class even though I had high B's on two of my three exams. The final is worth 40% so it pretty much can make of break your grade. She's really sweet. Very annoying and anal though. Kind of goes over board with the color coded test and what not. Class attendence isn't necessary. Just recitation.
1722,poor,"This is one of the worst classes i've taken. the concepts would have been easy to understand if he had any clue how to explain them. The material on the tests is so random compared to what he teaches in class. He doesn't prepare you well for the tests at all, and the owls are a pain. Don't take this class unless you absolutley have to."
1059,poor,I got an A in the class and can say it was the worst class I took last semester. I had no idea what my grade was going into the final and wouldn't have been surprised if I got an F. There is no homework but most people have to study every day because there is a quiz every discussion and every Friday. Good luck...
3242,poor,"Class is Hard. The professor could be more helpful, more clear, and generally more caring. Ther are 3 tricky exams which you can't keep to to study from, online homework which are due over the weekend and a CUMULATIVE 70 Question Final.Do the homework as soon as it is available, make some friends ASAP, and do questions on the end of each chapter."
1678,poor,the worst professor i have ever taken a class with. seems nice but lectures make no sense. homework has nothing to do with the tests which are all 15 qs each/85% of your grade so if you mess one up you're screwed. unfortunately hes the only guy who teaches 128.
1757,good,Respectable teacher. Friendly and energetic. Not to good in explaining concepts. Couldnt get myself to focus on what he was talking about
4191,poor,this class is online course it is not easy at all .the lab wasnt helpful and the text book are useless so dont even try to buy the book . She is a nice proffessor but she doesnt teach in class only post her lectures online . I highly recommend to start teaching the material in the class it is not easy as people think . I have even took fiance 301 a
563,good,"decent professor, makes mistakes, but isn't afarid to admit when he has, which is good.  Helps students out during lab time, odviously has a strong commitment to helping students, and his tests / exams are never unfair in diffculty"
2790,poor,"explained concepts well, but his tests are HARD, bad professor in comparison with others, recommend people switching to another professor if you got him, he is such a *^&lt;!!!"
863,average,Much better class than math 127 and much clearer tests. Cook ads his unique personality to math somtimes making it fun and at other times it makes class very confusing. Good teacher that means well but you better be ready to read the text if you want an A
1484,good,a
206,poor,"First, if you're a biology majore and want a good teacher and learn from good wisdom this is the teacher for you, however this teacher is really hard to hear and this class may come off as esy, but its not. The exam challenges you in ways you did not expected its the mixture of testing you in a complexs way. Basically if you space out too much, dont take his class. "
870,poor,No Comments
502,good,he's good and good looking. a bit boring at times when he just reads and reads. dont buy the textbook and download the lectures on angel. take notes. sometimes there is more on his tests than he alludes to. if you want an A you will have to spend sometime before the test studying.
1028,average,"BioTAP is very different from other intro bio courses. The semester consists of 3 major projects, no tests. This would have been fantastic except we never got back the first project, which led to a lack of motivation for subsequent projects. Also, it's not super clear what he's looking for, but he grades generously (we think)."
3840,good,"Bauman is a firecracker! I love her! Very sweet and really knows her stuff. Grades hard because she wants you to understand the material, not just memorize it. If you are struggling she will go above and beyond to help you. I am so happy I took her class. It was challenging but entertaining."
2690,good,No Comments
1570,poor,this class is so horrible..i still dont know how he is the head of the department or even how he got this job! DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!
2773,poor,stop Strrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreetching your words!!
2731,poor,"He's a jerk, cocky and unreasonable.  His testing is horrendous."
804,good,"It's not too difficult. Just study the material. Even if you're bad at math you can get a good grade. Just make sure youre not lazy. Most of my friends didn't do well  b/c they were lazy, not b/c the it was hard, bad instructor, whatever bs. ect."
3645,good,"this class is veryy hard if you're like me and bio is not your thing. but i recommend this prof for this class.. grades fairly, review sessions, and very energetic. dunno is she's gonna curve though... hope she does. *sigh*"
2454,good,"HE IS SOO COOL, HIS LECTURES WERE FUN BUT THE TEST WASNT"
3104,good,"Flaherty is into the proofs but not into showing what they do or how they can help you on an exam. The TAs have to sometimes &quot;reteach&quot; the material because he sometimes fills the board with useless proofs with no examples. It's a doable course however, just don't rely on lectures to help you much. Bring your clicker!!!"
200,good,"he knows what he is talking about. Great class, easy A if you study. you don't need a book, just read his lecture slides and study his old exams then you will do fine"
3099,good,"Funny guy, nerdy in all the right ways. Lectures were good and he takes time to comprehensively answer questions. Tests were hard as hell though. The man loves his proofs, but tells you in advance so you can skip if you're disinterested in the formal junk."
2278,good,"great course, great prof"
3561,good,A great professor. All u need to do: study her lecture notes and power points ans u will get a good grade. she is the best and she makes bio very interesting and very easy to learn
391,good,"Good teacher, difficult class. This class is designed for people who enjoy biology and/or biology majors. Do get a good grade you have to put in some time and effort. The teacher is very helpful and witty, so lectures are entertaining. The exams are very detailed. All in all, I'd recommend him to people who are willing to work to get an A or B."
1495,poor,he's a terrible professor and shouldn't be teaching
2695,poor,The worst teacher ever!!! very boring lecture .....i feel depressing.
2027,good,LOved it got and A-. very easy class no book needed she print out the notes for u the test is exactly whats on the notes
2568,good,"Makes class really interesting. Was actually enrolled with a different prof bu found Zuliani's class to be much more engaging and fun (no reading off slides!). Definitely an asset to attend class as she makes i much easier to understand the content. Overall, make sure to practice for the midterms/exams"
64,good,"I didn't know a thing about comp sci before but this class got me hooked. Extremely helpful and clear although the class may be challenging. His humor is a great addition to the course. He is a really nice person as well. His class will have a big impact on you as it changed my major for me. Overall, good is the word fits him most accurately."
3884,good,I absolutely love professor Bauman!!! After taking her class I seriously considered becoming an Art History major (not really but I loved her class). She is so engaging and passionate about the topic. Her class is not an easy A but easily attainable as long as you pay attention. Highly recommend her!!!
2062,good,she is a great teacher
492,average,grades are only based on quizzes and tests. tests are word for word from the notes and movies you watch...quizzes are harder and from the text books.
379,good,"he's really an good teacher. laid back and really relates to the students. i love his stories and how punk rock he is. his tests are kinda hard, but as long as you listen to his lectures and do the problem sets you should be ok. overall this class was really interesting and made me want to go to lecture because of him HES good!!!"
3993,poor,"This class revolves around a project that you are given minimal instructions on. Lyons comes into class everyday with his same rude attitude. His lectures barely touch on the syllabus,  the exams are really tough. This class and the instructor serve as a prime example of Mason's lack of consideration for the education they provide to their students"
1076,poor,"Easy class to get an A in, but totally useless if you are looking to learn biology. WARNING if you are a Pre-med: you won't learn anything for the MCAT in this class, so prepare to learn it ALL on your own. (I'd also recommend taking 285 before you take the test, because that ended up being very helpful.) Phillis is the worst."
878,poor,i hate calculus..but i guess he knows his stuff..if i went to class i guess that would help...
337,good,"Don't get cocky. I got an A on the first exam, but stopped attending class and depended on just reading the book. You can't do that with the genetics portion. When I came back after being humbled, he started Bible hating and ramming his pro-evolution throats down our throats. Easy B. Lol, if you google him you can find his myspace page. Weird."
1016,good,"He is an amazing professor if you like to work with diagrams. He is all about application and less about memorization. Just a truly amazing class, he is basically the only good teacher for this course based on what I have heard from my friends. 10/10 would recommend. "
1275,good,"Professor Rahhal is my all time favorite professor. She is very clear during lectures and makes sure that students are engaged in the topics at hand. She makes people laugh from time to time, thus making learning fun (which you don't hear often). Anyone who has the slightest interest in Psych should take this class. "
3798,average,"DONT BUY BOOK! WASTE OF $$. easy class, just do the study guides and thats it. if you go to lecture you will get all the answers."
3342,good,"I didnt think she was a bad teacher at all. She was enthusiastic about the subject, she answered all questions clearly and concisely. Its not an easy subject to learn, but its not rocket science. Read the chapters. Go to class. Dont wait till the last minute to start studying. If you've made it this far in college, you'll be just fine in her class."
995,poor,Jumps right into the material. Took AP Bio but still struggling because AP bio wasn't close to as in depth as he is right off the bat. He cares about having the students do well but lectures off of diagrams that you can't really take notes from.
1981,good,"The best teacher ever! Shes fun and extremely funny! Gives out candy and apples if you answer questions! She gives old tests as review before the test, all the notes are online, she provides a note packetage, and after about mid term, she gives you extra credit just for coming. Shes great and easy!"
4297,average,Just read the textbook and do the study guides he posts and you should do fine. No need to show up to class at all!!!!!!!
161,poor,I have never hated a class so much. I go to every lecture and get absolutely nothing out of it. And the book won't help either. His syllabus is all over the place so you never know what to read anyway. Good luck :)))))))))
1500,poor,"Got an A in the class because I went to Calden's lectures. This guy is a total d-bag who deserves to be shot, and shot again"
3843,good,"Lisa is fantastic! If I could take her class again I would. She is hilarious and approachable. As for the actual class make sure to take each test as there is only three given and make sure to do each study guide. Take clear, understandable notes because she doesn't post the lectures on blackboard. Otherwise, she is super great!"
2613,average,Irritating professor with a nasaly voice that does little more than read of slides and presents sloppy problem sets with little relevance to the material on tests. Unless you took accounting in high school prepare to get ****ed over.
3461,good,"Dr. Fondufe is very knowledgable, energetic, and caring. She really wants her students to succeed and she is accessible outside of class. I really appreciated how prompt she was in responding to my emails. Attendance isn't mandatory but trust me, don't skip class or you'll get behind and be lost forever! I would highly recommend Dr. Fondufe!"
1021,poor,"So. Damn. Confusing. He talks in circles and will say to you ""I design exam questions to trick you. I want to trick you."" No help."
3073,good,"Very funny guy. Lectures are pretty rigorous, class was pretty standard calc 3."
3943,good,"Highly recommended for the Fine Arts requirement.  Dr. Bauman is personable and student oriented.  Her lectures are interesting, but don't expect much class interaction.  She's also a perfectionist, so be sure to spell words correctly."
1585,poor,"I really wish all those other entries below over-exaggerated, but sadly they're true. And yes, he does write EVERYTHING word for word. Augh"
1955,good,"She is a great professor. Loved her class. She brings snacks to class, and is a sweetheart. If you have a problem or need help, she is willing to help you. Can get a bit boring, but I enjoyed the course and didn't put in too much effort to get an A cause lots of the quizzes/ tests are online."
3152,average,She's not as bad as everyone is making her out to be although she is not the nicest person at times. She's very clear on what you need to know for the exams. If you listen to what she says and practice the Connect quizzes/homework you will pass this class. Make sure to read the textbook before class as she can be pretty fast paced.
34,poor,"First of all, it is true that she tends to grade and identify with the more liberal side of the political spectrum. That being said, conservatives should try to avoid her classes because although she claims she doesn't opine, she does. Also, she limits intelligent writing with all the rules and stipulations she imposes on assignments."
4014,poor,This class scarred me to the point of changing my concentration to something other than security. You won't know if you'll pass the class all semester. Rarely posts on BB and exams are based on what he says rather than bookslides content. Beware...
775,average,"He is extremely confusing but if you sit up front and persevre and ask questions you'll get the material and an A. Do the hw to boost your grade. ASK if you dont get it, he will definetely clarify."
2556,good,He makes everything very clear in his section
1478,poor,Doesn't give the benefit of the doubt.  He would flunk a senior if given the chance.
1363,good,She got me interested in psychology. It's now my major! I never missed this class.
2612,poor,No Comments
2824,good,"This prof will teach you theory behind the probability. If you are interested in going into statistics, then you will learn a lot from him. Otherwise you would probably hate him, for all his questions on the tests are theoretical."
2041,good,"I really liked the teacher and I thought she was really cute. However, her tests could sometimes be tricky which annoyed me. All you really have to do, though, is study the packet and look at the website (which is really good). She also has extra credit to to get extra points on the tests."
241,poor,"He will tell you that you do not need the book, you need it. He constantly asks questions based on information in the book and says ""I expect that you read this in the book"". He will also explain things very vaguely then proceed to ask clicker questions about the information. I could have gone anywhere with my GPA and ACT, I regret UIC even tho $"
2061,good,No Comments
2363,poor,Changed the test format entirely when there is a TA strike.... EVIL...
600,good,Great teacher! I was intimidated by the syllabus the first day but as long as you do the reading and study you will be fine. I took him with a full load so it's POSSIBLE! You just have to TRY! :)
2435,good,No Comments
2888,poor,"Okay I am going to be 100% honest with all my words. He has done what he was supposed to do except making guideline for final exam. Things are not hard at all !!! but whats going to kill you is the amount of things that you memorize. Even if you read a lot, it won't help at all because repeatedly reading textbook is never going to help"
646,poor,IS this an advanced literary writing class or English 1301? VERY FRUSTRATING!! He puts stipulations on essays that are RIDICULOUS!!
3890,good,"Quit being lazy. Her class is much easier than other arth101's professors. I loved attending her class and hearing her life stories. She made the class VERY interesting and I wish she taught other classes as well. She gives you a study guide for her EASY exam. Obviously if you skip, you're gonna fail."
3556,good,"Classes aren't mandatory, but you need to go to understand material. She's a really nice persona and very helpful. 7 clicker quizzes, 2 dropped. 3 exams and final. final consisted of 2 parts. 1 was new material-50 q. and 2nd part was from the old exams. Actually study for the exams. She puts tricky questions, but overall its an okay class."
3202,poor,"Not the best option out there- I spent most of my free time in tutoring. Without the TA's and the tutoring center I would have failed. Be ready to READ the chapters over and practice the connect quizzes A LOT. Practically all test questions come from the connect quizzes, the homework is pointless. 3 tests + comprehensive final. Be read to WORK!!"
1528,poor,If You Can Don't Take This Class.He was the worst teacher i have ever ever ever had!
1267,good,"Study. Read everything assigned to you and you will pass with an A. There are pop quizzes which encourages attendance as well as many extra credit opportunities through SONA which can boost your final grade by 4%. She's very energetic, nice, and somewhat attractive once you get to know her. Her lectures are amazing for an 8 AM. Study 4 tests"
1899,good,"played music before lecture to get us awake, and plays clips from movies and shows as examples of things in pscyh"
3005,good,"the best prof i have ever had...lol he made me laugh with his &quot;sexy promoters&quot; and his little hands in the air dance...&quot;hey learn! don't look at me, write, i'll give you a picture if you want and you can look at me later...learn now!&quot;"
2734,average,terrible notes
189,good,Bit opinionated/offensive but not demeaning or in anyway. He is respectable has a great sense of humor overall nice guy. If you can do the practice exams and study the powerpoints well easy A
1806,good,"Cool professor:  uses twitter to post exam questions & answers.  Uses online format, Internet, and Power Points.  Vibrant & vivacious.  Plays music from her iPod to get the morning class rocking off to a good start.  She's a more &quot;mature&quot; professor, in a very cool way- like Betty White but brunette and hotter. Attend & you'll get an easy &quot;A.&quot;"
975,good,"There are many options for Jr year writing. Professor Schurter is by far the best, and one of the best teachers at UMass period.  He has a deep and genuine interest in helping out his students.  Grading is extremely fair, material is very relevant.  You're allowed 3 absences but once you meet him you'll never want to miss class.  Take 310 with him."
2747,poor,"Boring course, boring profs...what else can i say!"
2047,good,"good professor. shes thorough and explains things very clear. I advise anyone to take this class, its pretty easy, and tests arent bad at all. shes funny too!"
2558,poor,"says ""we can play that game"" a lot"
1082,average,"He never gives straight answer for any of your question and wants you to reason everything out. He doesn't know how to use spark so you don't know any of your grades. review sessions do help somewhat. If you took AP bio already you should be all set, but if not good luck"
474,average,knows his stuff.test are hard and lectures boring but he at times makes it interesting.
2904,average,"Interesting material, but tests are way too detailed, and there is a large amount of reading. You don't really need to go to lectures because almost all of it is covered in the reading."
4117,poor,"This guy is creating havoc in the  IT department due to his criminilasation of students and unreasonable expectations... It wasn't enough trying to avoid him at all cost this semester, he went as far as mailing students in other instructors section what he expect for the homework assignments. By far THE MOST HATED INSTRUCTOR of George Mason!!!"
3385,average,She isn't the nicest person (she yelled @ a kid for leaving class to use the restroom) but she does really understand the material. The problem with her is that she goes through the material quickly & expects you to understand. I think how good your lab instructor is will really determine how well you learn the material in class. Good luck...
1184,good,"He's an entertainer... he makes Biology SO interesting and fun, although his tests are a bit hard. Just concentrate in class, take notes, and do those Duck quizzes!"
2433,good,he called me &quot;milady&quot; in a test once when i asked him for help.... needlessto say i swooned...
2391,good,"Great at teaching - clear, concise, and answers questions well in help sessions - but terrible at making tests. We know that you're good at chemistry, but try to see it through a first-year's eyes when making the tests, please. Class average is so low that he has to bell curve to keep the averages in the 60's."
769,average,"Really is a kind old guy, who likes to tell stories that sometimes last half the class. Likes to ramble and stand at the board writing and writing like we know what he's doing. If you aren't good at math don't take this class if you don't have to. Homework will bring up your grade a little, and if you show a lot of effort he may help you along."
1685,average,"I thought he was funny and down to earth, he didnt have an ego like most proff.  He does make the class a bit tough though, still a good guy."
130,good,"Extremely helpful professor.  He is willing to go the extra mile to help his student succeed, as he did for me.  I missed two weeks of class due to injury (concussion) and he stayed hours after his office hours ended on multiple Fridays to help me catch up.  He comes off as a jerk, but that's just his sense of humor.  A+ professor"
2919,good,"You will meet few professors who genuinely care for their students as much as Prof. Tepperman. He expects a lot from his students and they have every right to learn from him. He is easily misunderstood by students unfamiliar with his teaching-style, which is more participatory and democratic. He has devoted his entire life to teaching & scholarship"
3171,poor,"DO NOT TAKE ACCT 203 ONLINE, the online part of the class is simple however her tests are nothing like the online portion. I was actually learning and doing well until I took the first test. I had to withdraw because I knew I would fail the class. I spent a lot of time and effort learning but you have to know acct like your ABCs to pass."
3444,poor,"This woman is the worst professor I have ever had. She is unhelpful and a terrible teacher. I have not learned anything and she makes people cry at least once a week. Do not take any ACCT classes with her if you can help it, she's a fotze!"
466,average,"Interesting subject matter and does a great job on lectures but that's about it. There's 4 tests and that's all he uses to give you a grade. Doesn't even take role/count participation. If you do poorly on one test you're basically in trouble so make sure you don't skip any classes, take notes, and study."
3092,good,"Summer of 09, thought he was hilarious. One day he came in was like &quot;so I woke up at 4 am last night, couldn't go back to sleep, and remembered how to do the proof I wanted to show you guys yesterday, so I got out of bed and wrote it out. so here it is.&quot; The man loves his math. Upside: entertaining. Only downside:  spends too much time on proofs."
3772,good,Really easy class...class was never mandatory except for exams obviously. I never studied for the exams and passed them with a C but ended up getting a B+ in class. Good professor...she's really kind and enjoys teaching but sometimes she was boring. This class is good if you aren't a science major and just need the gen ed credit!
860,poor,He's a nice guy but his lectures are all over the place and he seems to not know what he's talking about. His lectures are VERY unhelpful. If yoo've had clac before he's ok but if it's your first time taking calc avoid him at all costs.
