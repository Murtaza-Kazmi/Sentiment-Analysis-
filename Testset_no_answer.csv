2437,"Fun lecturer, tho what he teaches is by far the easiest part of the course. I dout that he could spice up the dreadful reaction mechanism part of the course the way that Winnik did."
3470,She is a very kind professor. Her lecture is extremely clear and she is more than happy to help you if you ask for it. Highly recommended!!
3867,"Professor Bauman is one of the most inspirational and passionate professor you will ever be lucky enough to take a class from. Her lectures are poetic, mesmerizing, and interesting. She is so erudite in art history(As Professor Gregg says, it's two words art and history and you have to know both) and she will make you want to take more! "
1784,the class is multiple choice but he just wants to teach it and get out
594,"Mr. Everett is a wonderful instructor. He has a passion for teaching and English, which makes his classes fun. There are a lot of essays but no more than expected. The class is ""hard"" if one is not particularly skilled in writing, but Mr. Everett grades VERY fairly. If he knows you put your all into it, he will overlook small mistakes."
889,"Please retire...you waste our time. Unclear, inconsiderate, unprepared, and lazy"
1850,"She would sometimes lose her train of thought in the middle of a lecture, but the class overall was good with lots of demonstrations. It's also VERY easy, but skipping class isn't a good idea because the in class papers can give you a lot of freebie points!"
2936,"He's  passionate about sociology & stats.  The Think Twice book is great.  The workload is crazy!  The test don't reflect the learning (he's a stats freak).  He thinks he's politically correct but he often makes inappropriate & assumptive comments, but shockingly he admits when he's wrong.  Breezes through his slides.  Tough course but interesting."
1672,People are so bad at math. Thurlow is a decent teacher and so funny
429,Alan  Molumby is a doll! hot hot hot
3178,"Read, practice, do the homework because that will help your grade if you get a low exam score, and practice. Helpful if you ask. Final is multiple choice only. Good luck."
252,"Unorganized. Id rather read and understand the book than be tested on powerpoint slides that force you to memorize for the tests instead of understand the material. he literally said he expects us to know every word. Enjoyed lecture but as far as studying, it was more independent based and for me I prefer more structure. ull do fine if u study hard"
3075,"It is hard to teach to a huge class. Even with that in mind, he is pretty boring, and at times confusing."
2990,He is very good!!!
3279,"useless, worst prof ever. very rude, dint know what she is talking about, never take her. take my word"

2413,"Interesting lecturer.  Tests are ridiculously hard.  Sexy if you fancy the undernourished, Hugh-Grant-stuttery, very rehearsed type of guy.  He appeared friendly and approachable, though I didn't go near him as my every waking moment was spent reviewing the text and praying.  Did I mention his tests were hard&#63;"
2598,"I liked her in mgt120. You expect profs to be very helpful during your higher years, but she wasn't. She played favoritism in/outside classroom. She's lazy, the course was designed so that she didn't have to teach(you'll see). Lack of course organization really affected your performance in exam (cus' you don't know what to study!)"
2915,"He wrote both of the textbooks used in the class (each chalk full of spelling and grammar mistakes).  Disorganized lecturer, but the tests were super easy."
290,"As a 5th year senior looking back, I found his classroom model to be inappropriate and unprofessional. He fails to properly prepare people for future coursework: He poorly taught research work ethic and skills (critical); lack of directing focus to lecture material.. Also, office hours are purposely set to make it hard for you to get to them. Yeah."
903,"She is what other professors should look towards as a role model on how to run a class: respectful of her students, very informative, but does NOT allow other students to gain the upper hand during lectures. I am honestly looking forward to more classes with this professor."
4302,"Do NOT take this man's class. Do not do it. He lectures mostly about race and suicide. Every chapter comes back to that, even if not mentioned by text. About 10 quizzesexams throughout course. His lectures are terrible but you never have to go to class. Read the book and do the study guides but There is more stuff on the quizzes than on he says. "
2098,AMAZING PROF!!!
4236,"My experience with the teacher is that she likes to look pretty, but her exams are not that pretty.  I got a sense of laziness in teaching style and relying too much on slides and videos. Also too focused on people cheating and not on how to move forward in the class and pass it. I got a feeling of not trusting students, like everyone is out to che"
3396,Her tests are pretty straight forward and imho very easy. If you can't get an 'A' in this class don' t even bother to become an accountant. She is not the best of teachers but the material itself is a lil dull anyway.
2283,drop this course b/c of him...wasted of money and time
1130,"I'm not too fond of BIO so for me to take this class as a GenEd was a huge mistake. First off, Phillis is a good professor but I just hated the way he taught the class. And you have to come to class each day because of PRS and there are weekly quizzes...His tests are multiple true/false questions. Hated it though!!"
432,"Study hard for the tests, tough class, lab sucks, but the teach and TAs were awesome.  Molumby wears spiked belts and t-shirts to class, laid back.  You'll HATE drosophila flies by the end of the class!"
2800,McDunnough's teaching methodology is absolutely brilliant. :e is very fair and approachable and his online notes are excellent. If you want to succeed in his courses then you need to be willing to put in 5 to 8 hours a week. 5o all of the homework problems and attend all lectures. He does an excellent job explaining the material and if you are stil
4159,"He is a rather strict professor, but as long as you pay attention and keep up, you should have no problems. I took IT Security with him, so that could explain why he is strict. He curses in class sometimes, so that was kinda funny."
3569,"Shes the best, easiest biology professor there is. Why&#63; Cause she knows how to teach. This is the first time i had bio since 9th grade. I got an A. Her exams are easy! I dont know why she has a low rating. Just attend class and read the book occasionally. All my friends wished they took Dr. Fondufe. I wish she taught upper level bio courses."
2031,"Two words: simply amazing. Dr. Goodenough is one of the nicest and funniest professors I've ever had. She totally realizes that the class's interest level is fairly low and does her best to create a clear, concise and very EASY curriculum. Attend class and you'll be fine. My only complaint is the 75 minute duration of the lecture. It can be brutal."
1840,She's so wakes you up at 9 in the morning. Clear and interesting materials. It's an easy and useful class to take for GenEd.

3189,"Hylton is rude and intimidating  and teaches really fast, so you need to be in class and taking notes, AND reading a lot on your own and practicing Connect 24/7. Don't take her unless last option. There's weekly online Connect HW & Quizzes, 3 tests, 1 cumulative final. 2nd part of tests is free response. Be ready to stress & read A LOT!!!!! "
443,Great guy but the material he teaches is very boring. Thought his class would be more biology based but it felt more like a history class. The exams are mostly people and dates.
1741,"Don't take this teacher if you don't understand math. He is n help, so if you can't teach yourself you WILL fail"
3434,This woman should not be a teacher. Her lectures are crap because she just reads off stupid powerpoint slides. Oh yeah and the lab instructors are no better....They speak zero english and always confuse shiet with stuff they learned from their own country...I regret leaving UVA for GMU...it's a joke
17,she is the worst teacher that i have had in college she sits on her high house looking down on her student. she also has a hearing problem and the tests that she give are hard.
1221,Going to his class was the worst part of my day.  He was an a lousy teacher.
4374,This teacher is the nicest by far. He has good intentions and always jokes with his student but isnt too clear on the lectures. His tests are multiple choice but they are very detailed. However he counterbalances this by putting a lot of extra credit questions. Hes cool overall but the class is diff
2654,Excellent!! Learned a lot.
2822,He emphasizes theory a lot. Good for courses like STA447 and if you really want to learn the theory. Knows his stuff and very helpful. Also a very funny guy which made the 3 hour lectures on thursday night bearable. Overall one of the best profs I've had at UofT.
1457,Thinks he knows what he is teaching but in reality the students don't get it and he gets frustrated and complain about them not &quot;listening&quot;. Makes impossible exams even after failing to teach his class properly. Avoid him at all costs!
842,"The teacher doesn't teach the concepts. he only derives the formulae and doesn't tell/show us how to implement them. going to class, for me, seems like a waste of time."
1432,"She was a very interesting teacher, with very helpful examples in class.  she is also very nice and friendly when you talk to her.  I would definently recommand her class."
2823,"Took a couple courses with him years ago.  I thought he was an excellent professor.  Good at explaining topics, approachable, great homework & exam qns.  If you are interested in mathematics then I'm sure you'll hold the same opinion that I do."
964,Great professor.  If you go to his office hours you will get above a 93 on every assignment.  Respect him and he will more than respect youback.
151,"Way too much busy work in this class. The TA grades 40-45% of your work. There is no TA grading scale so it depends on the TA grades and how strict they are. During lectures he does not usually stay on track, and it is hard to find the time useful. He showed plenty of laziness this semester on separate occasions. I did not enjoy this class one bit."
318,"Worst Biology teacher ever! He is always off topic, it is useless to go to lectures, you will have to do everything on your own. Test are hard too"
109,What a nut. He's awesome.
3358,She makes you feel like you are in high school again if you walk in late and she will stop class and point it out. She goes very fast with the material and assumes that everyone has previous knowledge of Accouting. I was very turned of accounting after taking her class. If you study really hard and try your best you can definatelt pass. Go to lab!
530,This was the easiest class i ever took...yeah she is boring as hell but she gives you extra credit for no reason.  I did the bare minimum and walked into the final with 40 extra points.  Needless to say that got well over an A.  TAKE HER
1207,"Best professor I've had.  Teaches you how to think like a scientist, not just how to memorize facts."
2222,Brym is an amazing lecturer.  He lays out the major points of each topic very clearly and provides helpful lecture notes on the website.  He speaks at a good pace that one can easily take notes at.  My only beef is that the tests are insanely specific.
3088,"Everything was going well until topology, and it was crazy hard. Got a 35% on the topology test but with the curve, managed to get a high D. Good with exam appeals, and homework is definitely much harder than the actual exams. Don't put off homework to the day before it's due. Almost droppedpassfailed the class."
3646,"She is the cutest teacher ever: she acts out EVERYTHING, which makes it super easy to remember. (Lol like her little dance when talking about kinetic energy). Tests are almost straight from the notes, with the occasional problem from the book or website thrown in for good measure. Attendance isn't mandatory but since exams are based on notes ......"
3946,easiest class ever. if you take the notes you'll be fine. theres really no need to read the textbook. tests are easy if you study and take the notes. no pop quizzes or anything hard. a few papers but they're pretty easy. she does take attendance though but her classes are interesting and definitely not boring!
1174,Phillis is a very open and exceptionally tuned to the needs of the class.  He also is pretty entertaining during the Red Sox playoffs.
1378,She can effectively teach a class of 500...props
1186,Great teacher esp in such a large class
3690,No Comments
3492,"She is very kind and a good lecturer, though the class feels long and isn't mandatory. The tests are a bit difficult but if you study you should pass, I never study and am scraping by with a B. She has office hours and is very friendly, extra credit questions are on the tests and she is very generous with curves. "
1839,"Prof. Whitbourne is one of the most amazing professors I have ever taken a class from.  Her level of enthusiasm for the subject obvious and contagious.  Without her help and encouragement, I would have never continued on to a sucessful career in psychology.  I laughed at every single joke she made.  UMass is very lucky to have her!"
3507,"Fondufe is a very lively teacher who is passionate about Biology. Sometimes I would bring my boyfriend to the lectures and he sort of became annoyed by her voice, but I thought she was a great speaker. She was clear with how the course would be and made Biology an interesting subject. I would recommend her class."
315,everyone just get old exams and you will easily get an A otherwise your doomed listening and studying for his class your looking at about 6 chapters per test so no need to read all that junk get old exams everything is repeated from the old exams to his current one!
3074,"Weird sense of humor, kind of a weird guy, but a great lecturer. Very clear explanations and willing to take questions. Has a cute dog."
1936,Finds great ways to interest the class besides just lecturing.  Much appreciated
1427,Best class I've taken at Umass. Professor Rahhal is super nice and is extremely helpful. The class is so easy and interesting.
817,"Do yourself a favor and ignore all the ratings that say that he is of any help. I had a 3.8 GPA until I took this class, and FAILED my first college test with this guy. He might be a nice guy but he should have retired 30 years ago. I attended all of his lectures, along with turoing, and BOTH reviews before the test. Got 60's on first two tests."
3864,Learning art was quite boring at times especially during the end of the semester but she tries hard to make it fun. Pay attention to the examples and her PowerPoint slides she talks about in class because it'll def help you on the exams. She's very energetic and loves when people discuss their ideas. Study guides are basically exams. 
734,"Professor Cook is a great teacher. His lectures are clear and I learnt a lot from it. He always made jokes and it is a great fun to go to class. Of course, studying math always takes effort and sometimes tedious, but his class inspired me to learn more and keep going. "
625,oh my goodness he is passionate but he grades our papers as if are papers are going to be published. i am just trying to get a credit and this class is just dragging he continues to go off subject during lecture and his power points are super long. if you want to become a writer or and english major than by all means take this class. 
3984,"Antother teacher that likes to hand out a study guide. She tells you exactly what she wants and nothing else. For the test though u gotta know it well. Class is kinda interesting for an art class, but hard to keep awake in the dark. I'd recommend her."
2589,"not a very good professor. not good at lecturing and tests are unfair, questions a lot of fringe material."
4371,"For the love of god, he has a last name for a first name and a first name for his last name.  Terrible teacher with terrible exams and lectures. Avoid at all costs."
831,"He is a nice guy, but does not know how to teach at all!  Only take this class if you're comfortable with teaching yourself the material."
2929,"I can see how he is not too popular with the students, however his class was my only A first year at U of T. He is very straightforward and lectures go exaclty with the book. very clear slides and basically spoon feeds the information. multiple choice tests can be trciky, but once you get how to do them its better."
1024,"Randy is a really nice guy out of lecture, however, he is not the best professor. He shows an obvious interest in the material and makes lectures interesting but the tests and quizzes are really hard. Most of his questions are vague but similar to the ones taught in lecture. If you write them down and use them to study you should be fine."
2316,"kewl prof, interesting class, can get an A if u read the text &attend lectures!"
4036,this guy thinks he knows everything and his better than everybody else.  He treats his students with no respect at all.
3947,"This prof/class is unbelievable - one of the few classes outside of my major that I actually looked forward to in the course of the week. You become enchanted for an hour and 15 minutes twice a week, completely engulfed into the presented art. It's almost like you are walking through a movie plot that contains history and logic. You understand art."
1814,"Fun and energetic class. Material was really interesting. Extremely easy to get an A - just make sure you do all the SPARK quizzes on time. SONA experiments were a life-saver in this class: 20 points extra credit!!! Definitely take advantage of that. Go to class for the In Class Reaction Papers, really does damage missing those points."
471,STUDY and you'll be fine. I got an A in biological anthro and I am now pulling a high B in cultural anthro. Don't take his classes if your not prepared to work hard.
2807,Just do yourself a favour and choose a different section.  You'll learn more and get a better mark.
410,Very good class! TAKE THIS CLASS!! I strongly recommend taking it with him. Its not really necessary to attend the lectures as long as you have the powerpt slides printed out. He does give pop quizzes occasionally but if you do well enough on the exams you can afford to miss the quizzes and still do well in the class.
51,He's great
2439,&quot;Uh...&quot; &quot;um...&quot; Annoying!!
2920,great prof.
1391,I absolutely love this class! I dont want the semester to be over. She is the best teacher ever and you would crazy to not take this class. She makes hard material so easy. I actually dont mind studying for the tests. Seriously..take it.
621,"Isn't going to let class out early or give you an easy A; you HAVE to do the reading and  the work! HOWEVER, Everett is an exceptional teacher. Lectures are interesting. He gives you everything you need to do well. He's always there to help. Charming, laid-back, amiable-I will definitely be taking more classes with him. Thanks Professor! "
120,"St Alexander is a good experience for 301. Advice for when you're taking him: Youll be getting As and Bs on homework and exams with not much effort. Don't be fooled, the final -20 percent-  is rough. I only solved 1 of 8 problems on it. I wish Id aimed to get 100s on everything so I can learn the stuff."
3849,"As a person, she is funny and awesome. As a professor, she is strict and wants you to do the work in order to get a good grade. She does help you out in case you get stuck."
274,"Molumby is a cool professor, but his lectures are not that all interesting. Sit in front if you want to stay up. Exams are very difficult, and you MUST know the material because his exams are TRICKY. You have 3 basic answers, A & B, A&C, ABC, and none of the above. Easy B if committed."
2917,Worst professor I've had so far. Lectures are very scattered and unorganized.
3029,All I can hear in that class is &quot;RNA blah blah blah VIRUS blah DNA blah blah reverse transcriptase blah blah blah....&quot;
2024,Very technologically advanced for someone her age. Good at distributing salty snacks.
2320,"Tests are too picky and detailed.  They dont reflect those ""broad concepts"""
2555,he turned me into an organic chem genius
1871,Whitbourne was an aweseome professor. She explains the material clearly and you can buy the notes at the Textbook Annex which are really helpful. They're supposed to be supplementary but they're great if you miss class and/or don't feel like doing the reading. Really easy.
2245,"boo brym boo!  man, can't the guy slow down just a little during his lectures&#63;  who wants to listen to 2 hours of boring speed talking on tape at home&#63;"
3613,If you've ever taken a bio or chem class before this class will be super easy. Just pay attention to what she stresses in class and read the book. Its that simple.
915,shes great
3803,"I didn't even buy a textbook, and skipped like half the lectures.  But that's fine!  Going to class really helps but if you have buddies to study with this can be an easy A or B.  She even told us the first day that we didn't even have to come to lectures to hypothetically get an A."
287,"His lectures are not worth going according to my opinion. He just talks to the students in the front. Almost all the time, he spends time talking about stuffs that are not related to lectures and goes off tangent all time. Tests aren't that bad if you study the ppts word by word. Labs are useless."
1616,Freak Of Nature
1411,The class was amazing!!!!! I thought it might be boring being that there were over 400 people in the class but somehow Tammy made us laugh and throughly enjoy the class. Definetely sign up for the class!
179,"Alan is a super laid back and has some really funny stories to tell. Visit him during office hours and he will clear up literally everything for you, as well as make you laugh. Most points come from lab so don't worry if you mess up a test or two, because there is also an optional final. Really never had to use a book of any sort."
3406,"She was a very good teacher I though. She let me in the class without having the right prerequisites, so if you are in that situation don't be scared to talk to her about it. Her tests were easy but the final was pretty hard."
787,"NICEST TEACHER. EVER. He's a great guy. Go to his office hours. The class is terribly confusing and hard, but if you talk to him about your grade he can be reassuring.  Lectures are confusing but he will meet with you personally any time of day to talk about stuff in lecture or your grade."
1068,"Not a good professor, hard to understand, doesn't answer questions. Doesn't give grades back, and doesn't give clear answers to questions."
175,"Molumby is  a great teacher Cons: He doesnt speak into the mic so it can get hard to listen to his lectures occasionally.  His tests are hard and assigns 2 long papers Pros: Labs are very easy. He recycles old exams so get a hold of those and youll be set to get an A in the class He is pro-evolution, so don't argue otherwise. He is understanding"
764,"This man is one of the more un-helpful, not caring teachers i've ever run into. He honesty doesn't care about his students success and Is terrible at teaching. theres better teachers and even though the material isnt so hard, he makes it near impossible somehow"
1042,"Randall Phillis is a great guy, but his teaching style is very strange. He really likes to teach his own way without the book to get you to ""think about biology not read and memorize"" which I enjoy, but it also makes the class very hard. If you pay attention in class and go to the SI sessions you'll be fine, just don't skip!"
3952,"Probably the best teacher at Mason. She makes class so much fun! I wasn't looking forward to taking it b/c I know nothing about art, and I feel so much more passionate about art now...after 1 semester!!! Highly recommended to take her! You will get an A!"
414,"HE IS GOOD PROFESSOR BUT HIS EXAMS ARE NOT EFFICENT. THEY ARE NOT MEASURING WHAT IT NEEDS TO MESASURE. EXAMS AREE NOT RELIABLE AND VALID IN SOME CASES. SOME QUESTIONS IN THE EXAM ARE REALLY NOT MEASURING WHAT IT NEEDS TO. FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT IS THE LEAST DISCOVERED SPECIES HIS ANSWER WOULD BE LET'S SA"
1728,"haha this guy is a joke. i dont understand why peopole like him are allowed to teach, cus he doesnt know how. Dont even bother going to class. i went to  maybe 4 classes all semester. and i have an a-. sooo just pretty much teach yourself using the owls."
2844,"very easy if u memomize hard. You dont have to goto the class...read it yourself, and do (or memorize) the past yr paper...you will have the high probability of getting super high mark !!! Trust me !!!"
2586,she is soooo boring
3916,"Yes, you have to study. Yes, you have to go to class. However, Prof Bauman has more enthusiasm for her course than most instructors I have come across in a long time plus she is not bad on the eyes if you know what I am saying. She will break down what you need to know and is always eager to help anyone who asks."
387,"awesome professor, very intersting classes, practice exams=exams but make sure you read the chapters anyways."
3594,"I was doing really good in beginning, went to all of the classes, took the quizzes and took all the tests. But somehow I ended up with a bad grade and I studied and cared about this class! I think it's because I couldnt really memorize her lectures, you fall asleep because she talks too fast!!and her questions are tricky on exams even she admits it"
3518,"Let's start off by saying that I would have never went to class if it wasn't for the dreaded iClickers. She uses them all the time, and it is worth a good percentage of your grade. Her tests go something like this...  Question #3  A) A Possible Answer B) A Possible Answer C) I think that was an answer D) Both A & B E) All  Its impossible. "
3880,She is a horrible professor !! she acts like she's funny and cool in the beginning  .. but when you actually start taking the tests you notice how harshly she grades her tests !! and she teaches art history as if shes teaching calculus or something really important ! DO NOT TAKE HER UNLESS YOU NEED TOO ! DONT DOO MY MISTAKE !!
3275,I gave her a 2 for clarity because she repeats over and over what you need to know for the exams and stuff. But there's so much ground to cover that really you just have to know everything to get an A or A-. It was tough. You must read and study the book to get an A. She wasn't all that nice either. Very anal about laptops/cell phones etc.
1551,"I did not attend  class,"
4388,"This class was sooooo boring. It's one of those classes you dread going to. He's nice enough personally, but as a teacher, I would definitely not take him again."
720,very funny and laid back lady.  extremely down-to-earth.  this class is mostly a huge therapy session and has been great fun so far.
4073,"At first he will come off very abrasive, but if you pay attention and don't say anything stupid you will find that you will learn more from him than any other professor."
4154,"Yeah, if you get on his bad side you can expect him to grade you harshly.  I know from experience but managed to get a good grade in his class none the less.  I would avoid all possible classes with alternative professors in my major if I can :)"
4149,Best teacher i ever had. He knows more than any teacher I've had in my major so far. midterm and finals were hard as sh*t. 90 minutes for 90 (hard!) questions. learned a ton! he grades very fairly though. I got an A. go to class and you'll be fine.
1338,"BEST PROF. EVER!!! The class material is pretty standard, but she presents it so well that you'll never be bored. Go to the study groups before exams and you'll do fine. drops the lowest test grade and offers extra credit. def. take a class with her!"
1564,"THIS GUY IS AWEFUL. He writes down every single word he says, horrble teacher. tests are nothin like class, worst teacher ever."
4042,"Took his class years ago.  Maybe 2005 or something.  I worked my a** off and still got a D.  I am posting this because I now work for one of the largest Cybersecurity companies in the world.  I love my job and make more than Lyons can dream of. To this day the hell he put me through never helped me.  Stay away from his class, it's useless."
3025,"Approachable, nice prof BUT *high* reading load and this year exam is cumulative *boohoo* Tests are fair but you need to know your material REALLY well. VERY disorganized prof though and has some problems expressing himself really well. overall i like him"
1253,She's awesome!
4295,"Never went to classes, only test days and got a B. You cant just study the study guide because he will put other questions on the tests. To review for testsquizzes, read the whole chapter as well as study guide. Overall not bad"
3747,She is so sweet! She makes her lectures interesting and will work with you a lot office you need help
3678,"Wondeful teacher. What can I say&#63; She made me more interested in Biology. Definitely take bio from her. She is super clear, orginized, fair and helping.If you take good notes and study enough you are destined to get an A from her class.Don't even look for another teacher. Just sign up."
2447,"This prof has a quirky sort of charm to his teaching. Explains concepts pretty well, although it helps a lot to read the textbook afterwards. I think he's one of the best profs in the chem department. :)"
3034,approachable and easy going.  notorious repeater on tests.  over good
1052,"The content in his class resembles the content in upper level classes; however, his class isn't hard. Just go to the lectures, pay attention to what he says and you'll pass. He's a funny guy and wants you to succeed... it's just that his teaching style is unorthodox."
4180,"Prof. Wolf is awesome. She is easy to understand and very willing to help. I'd have a hard time finding a nicer professor. I enjoyed her class and would recommend it to anyone. There are some projects that require some work, but she grades in favor of the students. Definitely an asset to the Mason MBA program. Take this class...you won't regret it!"
626,"Prof. Everett is very passionate about literature and has put a huge amount of work into his online course.  If you are in college to learn and grow as a student, take his class. He provides all the resources you need to succeed.  You just have to put in the effort."
2720,he's a prof&#63;!&#63;!!&#63;!
2998,He is one of the best.Thanks for everything.
599,Don't take this online class if you're looking for a class that doesn't have ridiculous deadlines.
2034,she rocked my world everyon should take this class. a great gen ed
3437,"If your planning on being an accounting major you must take 203 with her. She is so well organized and detailed it will make 301 a joke. No accounting course is easy, just do the homework problems and pay attention to her review sessions."
297,"He never stays on topic, starts randomly talking about zombies or other things. Though it's interesting it doesn't help me learn!!! He's really weird but interesting so I do recommend him. U wont learn a whole lot from him though"
2944,"this is why first year at U of T is so brutal.  Easy classes made hard and unpredicatable to weed ppl out.  Tepperman seems like a good guy, but the test formats are way unfair."
1983,"Nicest teacher ive had.  Ex: The room we were in was hot so she just decided to start bringing us water and ice...seriously just a very nice lady.  Bit Odd, but still very reasonable."
2083,"very funny, really good professor, great course"
2299,"Terrible Prof, attitude problem -  new text every 2 yrs to make $$ off students"
1438,"She is the best. Full of personality & gets the whole class of over 500 kids interacting and coming to class. Plus theres TONS of easy extra credit!  She is sooo nice and clear on everything.  There are a lot of notes, but she does tons of fun activities!"
2873,originally was intrigued about the course. liked the material. he was absolutely boring & he put me to sleep constantly. his books change every year & made me spend extra $$ - the course is too overloaded - must do all readings with both books to JUST pass - no assignments - 2x 25% midterms & 1 final worth 50% - tough - slides not posted
3621,"She trys very hard to explain things...her exams are very tough a lot of the questions are from the book and the cd that comes with it. I think all the bio 213 teachers are not easy, but Fondufe is a mediocre. I suggest making sure you follow with the book, if you do there is no need to ever go to class!"
149,"Molumby teaches a college level course, meaning he expects you to have read ahead of the lecture. No handholding/lecture is supplemental. Learned a lot. Grade is majorly your test avg. only complaint-honors student and most effort I've EVER put into a class/ even organized a study group-got a B. Will spend the next year trying to fix my GPA :/"
1436,"very nice, gives lots of chances for extra credit"
4172,She is an AWESOME Professor. EVERYONE MUST TAKE HER!!! She is very nice and has great personality.
157,"I've had enough. In class right now, hes mad at students for not showing up to his useless lectures. Moreoever, he acknoweldged that everyone is asking what in specific to study for his tests, and his response: ""everything in the book and every slide on every powerpoint should be known 100%"" Would be reasonable if his ppts WERENT hundreds of sides"
4190,"Good teacher. Young, nice, and clear. She teaches both online and in person. Gives you everything you need to do well: slides, online lectures, in-person lectures. I never bought the book and I got an A. Tests are multiple choice. David Geller is a good lab instructor too."
4216,"Excellent professor, you can learn a lot in her class. She is very helpful, extremely organized and she makes it easy to learn obscure concepts."
2476,he makes me wanna go to chem class everyday!
2226,"Bad. Just plain bad.  Did not like the course.  I was thinking about majoring in sociology, but not anymore.  He ruined it."
2942,"ok i came into SOC101 thinkign it was a bird course..and its not! hes a very nice person who makes class interesting, but gives us extremely hard tests"
4225,"She has very bad attitude, hard grader. All Exams are hard. Also, STUPID lab report drive you crazy. No Choice because there ia no any teacher beside her. GGOODD LUCK."
3985,"Dr. Bauman is GREAT!!! She made art history really interesting, and she's very upbeat.  She's always willing to help if you need it, and she'll even offer help if you seem to be struggling.  TAKE HER!!!"
3683,"She is a good professor to take. Good at explaining material, uses various examples. She has very animated teaching skills. Her exams were not hard as long as you study her notes. A lot of note taking but worth the while. Highly recommended teacher!!"
693,"Great lady, kind and easy going. She is a bit unclear in what she expects on assignments but she's an easy grader. Turn something in, get an A. Two papers all semester. Don't bother with the books, although they are really inexpensive, everything you'll read is online. As far as research classes go, you couldn't find an easier one."
3165,This class is a chore to be put bluntly. The material is not super difficult but not the easiest to digest. You need to understand the concepts or the class will be very difficult as the material builds on itself. The instructor was accessible by email and would answer questions very quickly.
1749,"He is a very very nice guy, cares for his students but you will have to make all the effort for any help you want, and if you want an A be ready to do a lot of work and learning yourself because his lectures will not get you an A on the exams, which tend to be very tricky."
1515,"just drop his class...and if you dont, just go to someone elses class this guy sucks"
296,"Molumby is one of the most passionate biology professors at UIC. He is very intelligent, loves what he does and has a great sense of humor...totally recommend him to anyone! I really look forward to having him teach ecology and evolution next semester. Advice: You need to keep up with the class...he is serious when he expects you to do the work."
4247,Excellent professor!  Uses real-life applications to subjects that other teachers define just as textbook.  Very knowledgable!  Very approachable and friendly.  Highly recommend!
871,He's a very outgoing teacher.
897,"You only needed the books for tests and study guides are always given. However, we never talked about in depth was going on in the books so when study guides came around you didn't know what was on it. But test questions were taken from the end of each chapters. The final was super easy. Her directions are not specific."
551,"I really liked this prof!! He was definately my favorite. Very helpful and easily approachable. Makes sure you know your stuff and prepares you for the final. Makes you work hard, and gives hard tests but they aren't worth much."
2536,Very nice and sweet and cute.....really a good prof i say.  Da best so far...
2465,"I think his lectures are very fantastic.  I really love him... he's such a great guy!!!  But, I think he should get a hair cut though."
2619,"Going to class has little value since she attempts to rush through slides that she copied according to previous comments. I recommend doing all questions assigned. Most of her solutions to problems were WRONG, which shows slopyness, not acceptable in accounting. Bottom line, learn the material well. Not done course but I hear final exam is hard :("
1502,"If you're strategy in this class is to go to lecture, take notes, and listen to what this guy has to say, you might as well put your head in between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye in this class."
3350,She's not the best! she teaches but doesnt use her own slides. She can be unfair at times and she is rude to some of the students. Im just mad that she doesnt use a +/- grading system for this class! u could have one point to a B for instance(79%) I heard Harley was MUCH better
1395,she is a great professor...she involves the class a lot and tries to answer all relevant questions.... she also does a lot of demonstrations that make the class a little more enjoyable because you never know what's going to happen
70,"Very good professor, clear and funny."
1732,He sucks!!! Don't take this course!!
2028,"I took this as a Gen-ed, and had no real interest in the subject, but Dr. Goodenough was hilarious and basically tought a big Sex Ed course.  I didn't have to buy the text and she made all her notes available on webct in case you missed a lecture.  Tests were very straight forward. Seriously, take this class."
2417,"Difficult tests, too many pauses when he's teaching and generally very uninteresting."
1162,hes a very helpful teacher if you make the effort to go to class and the reviews overall the class was very interesting he definantly knows the material and theres a lot of ways to get points probably the best bio teacher there is
602,"Brit Lit I student- I failed his first exam, and aced his second exam. It takes a little while to get used to his teaching style, but if you ask for help he will do his best to assist you. DO READING & WRITINGS & SHOW UP FOR CLASS OR YOU WILL NOT PASS! You EARN your grade- English is my major, so if you did not succeed in 1301/02 don't bother."
4321,He might ramble a lot but as long as you print the online flashcards out for the test you will get an A. He is very sweet and tries to make the subject interesting. Take notes and study vocab and you will be fine.
4041,"He is one of the professor who enjoys insulting students who does not know the material well, avoid him if you can."
2659,"This course is easy to handle if you have taken accounting in high school. Otherwise it is difficult - get the textbook earlier in the year, teach yourself, and take it in the summer to do well."
2517,You would think that he would die if he actually helped a student.
3402,She can be intimidating but she &quot;scared&quot; me into learning and preparing before class in case she called on me.  Uses index cards to call on people randomly so be prepared.  I did well and I liked her as a professor.  Would recommend her if you tend to slack off or need motivation to study harder.
3317,"She lectures straight from the power points, which aren't hers by the way. Recitation is much more helpful than lecture but recitation is still a must to go to. If you pay attention, read the book, and do your homework you can walk away with a B. You have to try EXTREMELY hard for an A though."
2740,No Comments
3858,"Most engaging class I have taken thus far. Prof Bauman is energetic and an incredible teacher. She really cares for her students and will remember you outside the classroom. Two exams that come straight from the lecture, a field trip, and a design projects. This is the prefect art credit for those who aren't artistic but more interested in history."
670,very easy class and everything is clear... he's very helpful!
3520,"She's very enthusiastic and loves biology. Her tests are so confusing and way harder than other professors' for this course. Prepare to go to office hours, get a tutor, and read the power points until you have them memorized. 7 iClicker quizzes throughout semester, 2 are dropped."
2594,Didn't like her teaching methods. Didn't learn anything during her lectures. Bad experience overall.
1017,"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!! exams are extremely hard, and if you skip a class you will forever be behind. Save yourself"
1272,"Professor Rahhal made my first semester of college so amazing. Her lectures were ALWAYS interesting making me never want to miss a class. She is fair, kind, and mostly fun and funny to be around. She constantly has students participating during lectures which was wonderful. I would absolutely suggest this class. Wish I could take another with her."
3533,"I thought she was a great teacher. Do not buy the book, it doesn't really explain the more complicated things at the end of the semester. She only counts 10 iClicker quizzes and you don't even need to be right. The tests were pretty straight forward if you did the study guide."
1818,"Susan is a very enthusiastic professor. I've never met anyone as energetic as she is at 9 in the morning, but she makes class fun and interesting. The material is extremely easy and there is tons of extra credit. The tests are very straight forward and EASY based on the review points she gives at the end of lecture. take this class easy  easy A!"
1419,Easy Class. Fun Proffesssor.
2528,Love his luscious swooshy hair
1322,Prof Rahhal makes psych 100 a  very easy class.Her policy on dropping a test is very generous and she has a gift in making her lectures interesting. Attendance is not mandatory if you keep up with the book and a little bit of memorizing before the tests will no doubt result in an A. The people who dont get A's are dumb/dont pay attention/dont study
2124,"Really great lecturer. Recycles material from his own textbook (New Society) and the little book (SLDI). Don't buy the clicker, it's not necessary. Just READ the textbook and make good notes at lectures."
3035,"Wonderful enthusiasm, unable to speak clearly, incredibly disorganized!!!"
1417,Awesome class. Great professor. I highly reccomend
1222,An excellent teacher.
1952,"Dr. Goodenough is easily one of my favorite profs. You literally would have to try to fail this class. There's extra credit in addition to easy hw assignments every week. Book use is minimal, either go to class or use the book, but all the ""notes"" you need she will post online for free. She's super friendly and happy to help. Lectures are fun!"
134,loves to poke fun and enjoys teaching good teacher if you show you are there to learn he will help you if you dont care he wolnt either
677,Mr. EVERETT is very fair. He demands that you support your ideas. Some may call this wanting you to believe what he does... but he is really just trying to get you to think OUTSIDE the box. That is what college is all about after all.
415,"One of the best professors UIC has to offer.  He is an extremely interesting and kind individual.  Although his class is somewhat difficult, it is not one to pass up!"
298,"Cool guy, makes the material interesting.."

1393,shes just absolutally amazing. the only class i was will to get up for.
4156,"Refers to people he doesn't like as &quot;dickheads&quot; or &quot;script kiddies&quot;.  Doesn't seem to know enough to teach anything except encryption.  Many students were dissapointed with the material covered in the class, though some of it is not th"
3160,"I think a lot of people dislike her because she does some weird things, like take attendance on the 100+ size lecture, but only on the one right before the exam and it does not affect your grade if you miss it, but its for her sake.   I think she is funny and whenever she teaches, she teaches good. Labs are the main sources for knowledge"

3790,"had her for my lab,,she's kool n easy!def take her again"
1808,"Professor Whitbourne was fantastic! This 400 person, 9am class was actually really fun and interesting. Lots of in class activities and examples. Book came with lecture notes to fill out as she went through the slides. Extra credit discussion groups really help your grade! Everything was really clear and the online program we used was so helpful!"
438,"Good teacher, can be moody, but you will learn a lot"
371,"He's really attractive. Not so  much looks wise, he's not bad in that respect, but his personality is sexy. That is if you're into the ridiculously intelligent bad boy sort of thing."
544,"terrible! basically what was previously said, she reads off of a bunch of note cards and has no idea what she is talking about. i would not recommend having her as a professor otherwise you WILL have the worst quarter!"
468,"Professor Capelotti is a great professor; he wants you to LEARN and not just spit back answers for an exam. In order to excel in his course, you MUST study rigorously for his exams. However, he DOES prepare you well. Like I said, he is a great professor and an even greater person."
555,I'd say he's the best prof I had this year.
61,"Mehran is an excellent professor. When I took the class, he was the best professor I had had up to that point. (Keith beat him.) He gives you candy for asking questions, and he has a quick wit. Passionate about CS, but not as obvious about it as Keith."
2045,"Answered questions if you asked them, however made you feel stupid sometimes and shot back snotty remarks. Tests were made so that you had to know every single piece of information or else you wouldnt do well. I wouldnt take this class unless you like to be tricked"
3224,"she gives no respect toward students at all and always responds questions with a disdainful attitude.The lectures that she gives are not very helpful. However, the tests are not hard and the Connect online resource is very helpful. if you want to get a good grade, you must attend the recitations and do the homework."
4080,"When the semester started, he seemed like a mean person but he actually is not, he is very funny and entertaining. If you take his class you will learn a lot, guaranteed. Don't except to sit through the class to get a good grade. My advice if you want to learn, take his class; if not find some other teacher because this teacher will work your butt."
3048,"this class is pretty alright. the lectures by moylan are really great, but the lab TAs are confused and there are extremely unclear directions and expectations for the lab period. they grade the labs way too tough, but know what you're doing and you'll be fine."
2182,"He is an excellent public speaker!!! And his textbook was well written... Critisims: he is quit bias and does not have a complete understanding of science. He could use a biology course or two. Also, do not take this course is you are a visual learner..he does not put anything up on the sides except graphs..which also makes the class hard to follow"
1412,"Awesome. Very clear, makes things very interesting, hated to miss her class simply because it was fun to go to. Great professor."
1018,Good professor if you like microbio and you have an interest in cancer cells as he likes to talk about them a lot. His tests are tricky at first but once you get to know the style it gets easier. Quiz every friday but he runs a review session himself every thursday night. Do your research before picking a bio151 prof as they all teach diff material
3838,"Professor Bauman is an amazing professor who makes this course intellectual stimulating. as long as you show up to class, listen, and take notes you will do fine on the exams and the project or the final aren't too hard either if you put in the work. definitely would take a class with her again."
1482,I took Linear Algebra from him and he taught well for me at lease. At first you might fall into sleep during lecture but soon you'll get over with it. He explains hard textbook examples into simple problem.
96,he is an awesome teacher.....!!
1302,"Tammy is an awesome professor. 4 exams and only best 3 count. Weekly online quizzes that you only need a 60 on to get a 100. You have to go to class because she has spontaneous writing assignments that are worth a good amount of your grade. Overall, easy A if you study and do the work."

139,Tough but makes classes enjoyable.  Very helpfull.
2301,totally hot
1877,"i love this class. she plays music in the morning and you can fill in your lecture notes with theones she provides on the screen. if you go to class, answers and questions that will be on the test are given some days. there are always videos and class activities. i love it  just study for tests"
798,"Okay, here's the deal with Cook.  His class seems harder than it is because he goes on long rants about how to derive equations.  You DO NOT need to understand exactly how to do this, all you need to write down is the final equation that he derives, and understand when to use it.  If you memorize and understand these few equations, then tests are s"
3597,This class is not an easy class. You need to read each chapter and really understand the powerpoint slides to get a C or better. You need an iclicker for the quizes too. DO NOT Procrastinate!
2627,"those who took gr.12 acct, just like me, wouldn't find this course that hard. i know some friends having no knowledge in acct before u of t struggled a lot... but generally, i'd say her tests are quiet hard and don't reflect past tests.. this year, the final exam was the KILLER!!!!! GRRRR.."
2232,No Comments
2566,His notes are a bit confusing and disorganized.
642,Mr. Everetts class was very intriguing. I took British Literature I and before going into the class I thought I was going to dread it. He honestly gives you what you pay for. He teaches lecture style and he offers extra credit. Very thorough and good at explaining things. Very helpful!
1476,"By far the worst teacher I have ever experienced to this point in my life. Please,do not make the mistake I and several of my classmates did by taking Math 100 with him. If you signed up with this teacher, do urself a favor and DROP IT while you have the chance! I even had to file a complaint with the head of the math dptmnt over this guy!"
2561,A pretty good prof.  Very helpful
3281,"If someone cannot teach, doesn't enjoy teaching, and does not thoroughly understand the material to teach, then why teach, correct&#63; Hylton never stops surprising her students as she attempts to shut down many students' opportunities to pass. She blatantly states that she is a full-time employee, and is &quot;untouchable&quot; no matter what she does. Avoid!!"
2112,"Considering the authorship on the texts used in class, and the consistent assertion that only sociology answers the pressing questions underlying other disciplines such as economics, philosophy, science etc., it seemed much of the material in the course was aimed at recruitment into the field of sociology. A bit dubious on the data at times also"
4307,"Take him if you want an easy A. He gives out study guides for all quizzes and exams, the answers come straight from the book and he sends them through email so you don't even need to come to get them. Explains questions if you ask him during an exam but never answers emails on the weekend so not really reliable in that aspect."
1910,Awesome teacher. Always has something up her sleve. Definatly one of the best courses I've taken this semester.
3107,z
461,STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS TEST ARE SUPER HARD!
2359,"Best chemistry professor. He makes the material comprehensible with just the right pace. Very clear in explaining and passionate. The tests are difficult, but fair considering the awesome quality of teaching. Doing homework problems are very important in preparing for exams in this course."
2066,"she was funny, and explains things very clearly. very good biology to take as a freshman b/c tests are not too tough."
3226,If you study for many hours before tests you can do well in this class. She isn't very helpful with providing help in accounting and is unclear in her lectures on what we should and shouldn't know. More of a self-taught class. Attending every recitation really helped me get a good grade.
3871,"I took this class just to get my fine art out of the way Freshman year, but I thoroughly enjoyed the teacher as an individual and the class. The first half of the course is lecturing and memorizing architects and buildings and the second half is a fun group project where we create a campus building. Class is fun and easy, and she is clear and fun."
150,"The class is out of about 415 points. Each exam is worth 80 points and you can take an optional final that could maybe replace your lowest test grade if you do good. If you do the old exams (and find other old exams from other students) and try to get all the right answers on those, the tests heavily will reflect that. Read the powerpoints a lot."
2926,"Had him second year and have avoided any class he teaches ever since...i'm in my last year and he is probably the worst professor i have had through my university experience...if he doesn't like you u dont get a good mark, and he just seems so arrogant"
4143,No Comments
2580,"hated her class, and her voice. cant even consider doing accounting because it would mean seeing her again. shes a terrible prof"
746,"If you aren't a math person, you may struggle with him. He tends to repeat the same concepts over and over, but tends to jump to other topics partway through. I personally just found his style of teaching the material very boring, but also very scatterbrained. He tends to try to branch out to other concepts that aren't relevant. No accent though :)"
4264,She is not nice when you need to talk to her. She can be very mean. I don't like her teaching style. She can be good looking but her mind is derty. Her exams are hard and horrible. No curve in the class even though class average is so bad.Materials are easy but they make the exam horrible hard.
2716,"MacKay is a good professor, but his lecturing style takes getting used to.  Overall, I found him to be very clear, and I found that he explained the material really well.  I found his slides were well organized and his tests were fair.  I liked his section the best out of all of PSL302."
3289,"Avoid her!!! She might be an ok professor for acct 203 and 301, but she is definitely the worst for acct 361. She doesn't explain anything and she goes so fast over the ppt slides that nobody could follow her. Labs-&quot;No, no, go back!!! Go there, no here...&quot; She is talking to herself. What else to say&#63; Good luck to those who want to try for a C!!!"
239,"His expectations are unrealistic if you have any other classes or if you have to work. Exam questions are unclear, making you second guess everything you think you knew. It is impossible to hear anything he says in lectures no matter where you sit, making note taking impossible because you only get 1/4 of the stories."
2399,Where did those tests come from&#63;&#63;  certainly not from lecture where this guy presented high school content.. not from the text or tutorial.. wtf is wrong with this school... it's easy test what you present in class not random****
1467,This is a difficult prof. he's asking tough probability questions in a math 100 class....
3711,"She is very motivated to teach her subject and can tell that she is really into Environmental Science. However, the class is really boring because it's simply a review of every science class in high school. Didn't learn anything and it was really expensive in all the materials you had to buy. Study for the 2nd exam! Everything else is really easy."
2732,Yay for pointless memorization!
1220,No Comments
3768,Wonderful professor. Her class is very easy especially for those who are not science majors. She gives several opportunities for extra credit and the entire lecture is based off of her powerpoints. Approachable and understanding. Acutally cares about her students. Great science class to take for gen.ed requirement. Look forward to her 110 class.
1263,Tammy is one of the best teachers I've ever had and I'm not even that interested in psychology. She splits the class into 4 parts (NO FINAL!!!) and she drops your lowest test and lowest writing assignment  but make sure you at least skim the readings. The online homeworks are super easy and straightforward. Would 100% take this class again!!
3432,One word..CRAZY!! Never had I had a prof. chase students out a a classroom or yell at students b/c they wanted to sit in the front. She lectures off of powerpoints that aren't even hers..thery're the publishers. You must read the book and do hw to do well.
1632,"His lectures were kind of all over the place sometimes and often the homework problems were different from the problems he went over in lecture which was frustrating. Get ready to read the book a lot. However, if you go to his office hours or the calculus tutoring center, he was usually pretty helpful. He is a nice guy overall and really cares. "
3941,"Amazing teacher.  Helpful, respectful, fun, fair . . .   really every complimentary adjective.  Just go to class and take notes or listen . . you'll get an easy A in what could be a hard subject.  She makes the class highly engaging and  VERY entertaining, so go to the classes."
3355,SHE IS THE WORST!!! Seems like she hates students and she has to make everyone miserable. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
1114,"Solid teacher. Offered review sessions for everything, which in most cases was helpful."
3887,Best Professor I have had at GMU. She makes class interesting  No need for the book but be prepared to take good notes. One presentation and a group project
308,Im sitting in his class and he just mentioned how people talk about his stance on Rate my prof. Thats laaammee.  Molumby is the biggest stud at uic. Im sure hes nodding his head as he reads this. Tough course. Lot of info.  Fair tests.
3608,shes not understandable
3787,"Had her for the lecture part only, she is very detailed. Lectures can be a bit boring, but I don't find science that interesting. Overall, she's a great teacher. If you have questions, its best to ask her in class. If you attend class, pay attention, and do the homework assignments, you should do great in the class!"
1829,"bad professor. psych of aging was easy, but she charges around $130 for her own book, which is TINY and useless. seriously, she is taking advantage of the students, probably because she is full of herself. she acts like she still wants to be in highschool. BTW, psych of aging has nearly nothing to do with psychology."
1309,The class is really easy. I highly recommend it. She drops the lowest grade on the exam.  I don't even have to take the fourth exam because I already have an 'A' in the class.
2458,simply......WOW!!!!
1978,"Human biology:  EASY.  Fantastic prof., grades super easy.  4 midterms (75% in class, 25% take home), 3 count, and an optional final.  Weekly HW, super easy.  Don't need the book, just read the power points and use learning modules on SPARK.  Entertaining classes too, information worth learning; not your usual sex-ed."
1158,relatively easy class. hes a pretty funny guy too so that makes it even better
3814,"rambles on and on, very very boring, tries to rush at end of class to finish her lesson."
2830,"He is a great Prof, very smart and resonable. His courses are very tough and harder than other Prof's. Anyway, if you are going to take higher level courses in mathematics Stats, you will find his lectures are very useful ,you really learn a lots from him and you wanna thank him."
2080,Professor Goodenough is such a good time!
2067,"She was great. Funny, explained it all well, and prints out all the notes for you, follwing along in class with printed out notes made it so much easier."
69,Mehran Sahami rocks.. And that's it.
1057,"Took his BioTAP class and it was great! Really amazing stuff - we cured cancer, came up with gene therapies, etc. He knew he gave us difficult projects, but graded accordingly. He's very understanding and helpful, and I really liked him."
4058,Hard teacher who will makes his homework harder than it needs to be. AVOID!
2615,"Hmmm... there was 13 classes during the semester and I went to it 3 times.... twice to pick up my tests, and once for the first lecture. Extremely easy course if you're not dumb or haf taken high school accounting... But again, I'm just very smart, I got 96 in the course."
2499,Amazing prof! He actually looks like one of those absent minded science profs in the movies! His lectures are fun and enjoyable ... although I still prefer Prof. Dicks... but he is still amazing!

4250,"Fairly easy class. Read the slides for the quizzes in lab (easy too), make a reasonable attempt at the weekly homework, and for the test: DO THE STUDY GUIDE.  It tells you all the concepts you need for the test- she gives it to you for a reason.  An easy A if you are willing to put in a reasonable effort."
166,"He's a very intelligent guy, it's just he goes off tangents a lot. Because he stopped doing iClickers, I stopped going to class because I learn absolutely nothing from his lectures (and I still learn more from studying than from his lectures). And yes, you'll need to study EVERY SINGLE DETAIL of his ppts. It will be on the exam."
1691,"Here's the deal. If you took Math 127 and actually understood the material, not just did well on the exams because of the cheat sheet, you'll have no problem. He wastes his time talking about the history of equations, but the course material is not nearly as bad as it's reputation. Mostly derivatives and anti-derivatives. Just get it over with"
3083,"Felt like we were running in the class before we could even walk, his lectures were a bit convoluted and not very helpful on HW.  The HW difficulty did not match what was taught to us, which resulted in overcrowded OH.  Also taught material not covered in textbook, thus hard to review the material on your own.  Probably worst class I've taken here"
790,the worst professor i have ever taken a class with. seems nice but lectures make no sense. homework has nothing to do with the tests which are all 15 qs each/85% of your grade so if you mess one up you're screwed. unfortunately hes the only guy who teaches 128.
1315,"Psych 100 with Rahhal is sick. She's an awesome teacher, is clear, and possesses a good sense of humor and some funny stories from her college days. Her exams are easy, as is the HW and such. The extra credit is helpful. Drops an exam and has spontaneous in-class writing assignments to make sure you read when she assigns special readings. Take it."
1720,"Nice Guy. Bad Professor. If you're a math major or are extremely good in math, youll be fine. For the rest of us, plan on struggling as u try to learn on your own. Class is a waste of time. I wonder how the math department could hire such crappy professor."
1880,"She's the best. I also had her as a mentor, and she was awesome - helped me every step of the way. I had an extremely successful career at UMass, and now as a grad student, and it's due in no small part to her. God Bless Susan Whitbourne!!"
1623,Cook is an awful professor. He's super nice but very old and thus rambles during lectures and is never very clear with concepts. You really need to teach yourself the material in order to pass because his lectures are all over the place. Try to take it with anyone else if you can. No book use whatsoever except to teach yourself the entire course.
80,Perfect.
911,My favorite criminology at the school and really knows what she is teaching about. Makes the average college student actually want to go to class. The class discussions and opinions really makes you involved and makes you form your own ideas. Took her 3 times throughout college and would take her again anytime i had a chance to.
2260,"He teaches well but everything is so scripted. He reads off his notes at the podium as if he wouldn't know what to say if he didn't have those aids. I don't like listening to his lectures, they put me to sleep."
1862,"easy gened. optional final which doesnt need to be taken as long as you take first 3 exams which are easy, book and lecture notes are important especially if you dont go to class...not mandatory to go but she does give surprise reaction papers and answers on tests...review sheets say EXACTLY what is going to be on exams which means an easy A."
2379,"The term test was a massacre for the entire class. average = 56 The difficulty was okay, it was simply the fact that there was no time to actually think for any given question. The slides provided are bare bones, must go to lectures to get the rest. Examples too easy, tests too hard."
1366,Makes the class really interesting and she's pretty funny too
2540,He makes Chemistry interesting!!
3666,"She is one of the best science teachers I've had!She is very interested it what she his teaching, or seems to be:)She had study sessions before tests that are helpful. I liked how she taught everything keeping in mind that you may not be familiar with what she is saying."
152,the class was ok you need to work hard and go to class and do the practice exams  ise math lena bhaiho bohath kharab kardiya ye gpa ko :(
1730,"The teacher doesn't teach the concepts. he only derives the formulae and doesn't tell/show us how to implement them. going to class, for me, seems like a waste of time."
1643,"One of the worst professors I've come across. He doesn't complete problems he starts on the board and gets confused half way through them. He isn't clear in his explanations, class average on exams is significantly lower than the other Math132 classes,  avoid his class at all costs."
3112,Too many proofs in class. I feel as if I am learning Analysis class...
4123,DONT TAKE HIM!!!!
2282,"Unhelpful, egotistical, and biased."
3422,wat she teaches and totally different then wat's on her exams! you gotta study REALLLY hard to get ur stuff rite!
1503,"I went to his class until I bombed the first exam then I went to Calden's class. Rudvalis is so incredibly confusing. I feel bad for him because people can be very rude..but honestly, he is a horrific teacher. Definitely take Calden's class, she is amazing and you'll love her class. Books are not necessary for either class, they're a waste of money"
8,A surprisingly challenging course. She struggles to answer questions clearly or even fully. Her pop quizzes are very tough. Her liberal voice comes out very often. Don't question her political opinion. She loves when you participate and are aware of current events. Read the material. Okay professor
1659,"While hes not the most with it professor, he knows the material well. The course is now streamlined with all the other sections so that the only thing that is different is the professor teaching it. Even if you have to take it with him you can go to any lecture."
2662,Doesn't know how to teach course.  Of course you have to read the textbook by yourself PRIOR to class - same for all courses.  OF COURSE - everyone know that the course is only 2 hours/week.
1161,Very great teacher. funny and an easy class to get the hang of
1789,"Professor Whitbourne made the class interesting, and gave many opportunities for extra credit. She rambles a lot to herself, but she makes the class fun and lively."
3014,"Superficial explanations of virology concepts. He enjoys using many anecdotes to keep the class happy, but at the expense of not teaching. Some of his notes are outdated. If you want to learn more about virology, take MGY378 instead."
2057,"Amazing teacher! The packets really helped to learn and study the material for tests. She explained things really well. She's hilarious which makes class all the more easier to get through, especially for non-majors. If you don't like bio, great class!"
4343,"Dr. Dennis is a nice man.  The tests were hard, but he did give out review sheets which were somewhat helpful.  There are TONS of opportunities for extra credit, so if you don't do well on the tests then the EC assignments can really boost your grade.  Most of the extra credits require attending a lecture and writing a short 2-3 pg. summary."
2288,"interesting lectures, intelligent prof, love this class"
1424,"Rahhal is probably my favorite professor so far here at UMass. She's so fun, cute, and energetic, and makes class easy to understand and enjoyable. Hers is one of the few classes I actually WANT to show up to everyday."
2181,"Has written an amazing textbook for the course, very easy read with numerous interesting facts. Readings are very insightful. Lectures are boring, doesn't speak with enthusiasm but he cannot be blamed. He has been teaching the course for 3 years.  Tip: Ask a friend to record the lecture for you."
309,"Go to class, study, and you will be fine. The end."
4355,"As long as you read the book you can pull off an A without ever stepping foot into the classroom (as long as you have someone to tell you when the tests are. 5 tests worth 20 points a piece, easy if you read the book"
2252,"Easiest course in the world. Anyone who says otherwise is in for a surprise in second year. Very helpful and gave clear answers. But the material is so self explanatory, you'd have to born under a rock to not ace this course."
2855,the course is not easy...encouraging and wants his students to succeed...
4390,"WTH&#63;&#63; don't listen to any of these people...this teacher is the easiest teacher in the world. His lectures are crap, so just study for his tests in class. Read the book and u'll get an A. He also gives a chance for 15 extra credit points for each"
497,This guy can kiss my rear. Everyone slaved for his class and from what I've heard only one person got a good grade and thats because he kissed this guy's ass. Made one student go on a long drive for a report and another he wanted to go to the archives. No wonder he isn't teaching AM ST 402W in the fall.
2893,"Worst professor ever. He was always very condescending and arrogant, and enjoys making fun of students' questions. A majority of his time is spent criticizing feminism and talking about his textbooks. Terrible professor, would not recommend."
184,Best lecturer ever... I wasn't interested in biology but after the first few lectures it became my life!! He's really knowledgeable about what he's teaching and makes you love going to lectures as long as you sit in the front... Lectures are amazing BUT wish he makes exams less complicated- it would've been a perfect class. 
1356,really nice and funny very interesting class!!!!

4357,"Exams completely based on book. If you go to class, you'll do better. And he'll like you better. Lots of extra credit."
1610,No Comments
812,"THE CLASS IS SO EASY THAT IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT, YOU WILL FAIL. COOK IS A NICE GUY AND HE GOES OVER EXAMPLES A LOT. GO TO CLASS, DO THE OWLS AND MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE OLD EXAMS HE HANDS OUT. YOU DO JUST FINE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T PROCRASTINATE."
305,"Professor Molumby is in two words, THE MAN. His lectures are interesting, and he provides some good anecdotes(NOTE:ANECDOTES WILL LIKELY BE ON TEST). A lot of people complain about the tests, but I literally took notes on the slides the night before and got an A in the class. Old exams are useful, but don't just limit your studying to those."
1558,what a horrible teacher. He explains things unclearly and seems to look down upon the class. He likes to write down a bunch of nonsense in his illegible handwriting and not actually explain any of it. He also says &quot;uuuuh....&quot; alot.
1022,"Randall is a great, but different. He doesn't give very clear answers on what's right and wrong which CAN BE tricky. Tons of TF. There is a quiz every Friday: can vary from open notemouth to strictly test testing. Tries to make the class interesting and loves what he teaches. Holds weekly review for quizzes. Definitely have to work for the grade."
4254,She is very unhelpful when you need to talk to her and looks at student different eyes.She has a attitude problem and she thinks she is pretty thats why she does that. I hope the department fire her. She is not a good teacher. Exams are very very hard and tricky.
238,"Great lectures. Little misleading when discussing exams. Does use book, lecture, and ppt for exams. Questions are vague really need to pay attention to the wording of what is being asked. When using practice exams do the work for the problems do not depend on multichoice."
4200,"She's not a bad professor, Very easy course, the online lecture are better than actually going to class, if you take notes while you listen to the lecture, that will help you study for the exam and not have to read the book.yes she does read from PPT slides and if it's not on PPT, it's probably from the book, but that's all there is to MGMT."
907,Hands down the best professor at West Georgia. Very funny and she knows what she's talking about based on her stories of experience. I'd take her again honestly because she will relate the material to life experience to make it easier to remember. 10 out of 10
4189,I did the half online half lecture and my lab teacher was pretty cool and easy. But the tests are so hard. I studied my butt off and i still got low scores. I feel like she tricks you with her questions
2114,"Lectures were sometimes interesting in content but delivery was monotone, repetitive and usually pretty boring. Very textbook-based; making notes on the readings will guarantee you a good grade. No major assignments; just three term tests (all MCQ) and an exam. All in all a decent prof who could definitely use some charisma/ sense of humour."
1231,good teacher
3732,"Such a sweet person, really cares about her students. She wants you to do well in her class, and makes it fairly easy to do so. You don't have to read the textbook to get an A, but it's actually well written and provides a nice context if you care about the material being covered."
211,"Molumby is a great professor, he knows his stuff and makes sure you do too. You don't NEED the book, but it helps reading it along with the ppts. He lectures off of his power points but his exams [recycled] are TRICKY. The optional final was easy but mainly conceptual as opposed to specific examples. he curved our section by ~4%. STUDY HARD."
2672,"Zuliani is an effective prof.  It's a hard class to rate since most people despise accounting and only take it because they want to continue through the commerce program.  Hate her voice or not, she knows her stuff and is very competent.  I like!"
84,"Brilliant, engaging, love this guy"
2510,Cute&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63; Are you guys blind&#63; He's old! But really great teacher!
4207,"The Best Professor that teaches in GMU. She is very organized, well prepeared, and well experienced in management. She makes you understands every concepts in MGMT and provide real examples not just read from the slides. No wonder, she's the only one that teaches MGMT in SOM. Three Exams and a Paper. that's it. She turns everything on time."
683,"Wonderful professor. Class consists of discussions every week, easy assignments, workload manageable. She really wants student to do well. Perfect elective choice!"
1480,"Attending class was a waste of time. Material was basic and you got to use a cheat sheet on ALL exams. Most educational material was the homework, on MathLab- the Professor contributed nothing to my knowledge."
4050,i read all those &quot;good&quot; comments and Im guaranteeing you those are ALL fake and lyons wrote them himself. THIS IS IS THE WORST PROFESSOR PERIOD. I dont mind hard professors cuz I like challenges but this guy doesnt even help u understand the material. If u ask a question in class he will kind of chuckle at dumb questions and others he wont answer.
1618,"Would not reccomend taking the 75 minute lecture block, just too much drole for uninterested people. That said, he does clearly explain math concepts. Just be a good student and actually read the book, learn the theorems and rules, and you will do well. Makes corny math jokes to diffuse a bored atmosphere but he teaches well otherwise."
3860,"Lisa is a very energetic lady. She can talk on and on about a work of art and gives very good information. Only downside is her old fashioned teaching method. She doesn't believe in posting powerpoint slides on BB. Also, no computers or phone use. Because of this, you must take all your notes by hand. If you can write fast, you should be fine. "
3697,Tons of busy work and make sure you do the tophots. The class is very expensive since she has you using a brand new textbook and online access code so be prepared to spend $200. For that reason I would not recommend this class as a general education class. Not worth the money.
3585,"Very nice lady, I just don't like how she lectures. I don't understand her.. yes you can ask questions but if you don't your alone. Its better to ask questions in person 1-on-1, EXTREMELY helpful if you do. In other words to get a good grade you must look for her since her lectures don't help. I failed this class thinking I would know the basics :("
1650,This guy is really helpful if you go to his office hours. His door is always open for people who want to learn. He is a great teacher
2323,a little too obnoxious for my liking...too full of himself
1192,"He is a very hard teacher, his questions are very tricky and his test are extremely hard. He is not very clear."
3530,"She is great, I don't know how can you not like her. I got a B+ without even putting too much effort. Yes, she reads from power points, so what?? At least you know where to go to find answers. Take her, don't but the book, though. I didn't."
3344,"she shows no respect to students and acts like she has won the Nobel Prize though there s no accounting Nobel Prize. I got an A. But I really hate her. Luckily, I don't have to take any of her class again.^^"
1846,"Absolutely without a shadow of a doubt the worst teacher ever. She wastes so much class time on rants. You take what she tells you to study, you study it and its not on the test. She is a worthless teacher, if you can call her that. Switch to a different psych 100 you'll learn more elsewhere. stay away."
3565,"Excellent class. Never used the book. Lectures are entirely power point based, which if you read them at home/or print them out for yourself makes learning the material very easy.  Tests are EASY - worded straight from the notes; 3 scantron tests & 3 quizzes (lowest grade dropped for each) and a final (cumulative). Take her, you won't regret it!"
457,"I find him to be an interesting and lively character. I never get bored in his class, I actually enjoy going to his class. His tests are moderate as long as you take notes, read the text, and actually study."
3159,"I think you will learn and understand most material from the recitation and online homeworks, so don't let her scare you. Show up to lecture and recitation ON TIME (she will call you out if you're late) and do the online homeworks. Exams are straight off the homework so practice them several times before exams and you will be fine."
2714,One of the worst profs at U of T.  A terrible teacher.. poor communication skills... and a very poorly written book (neuro 101)
3364,"Bad personality, Never curved,she doesn't know how to teach, unfair grade for project.She needs more teaching experience. Stay away from her. Worst teacher."
1929,Kept classes interesting
802,"Ridiculous professor. He never teaches the material--instead, he goes on about some obscure, random fact you never have to think about again. Only assigned like 5 OWLs that were extremely hard and nothing like the exams. Avoid this class if possible, if required for a major I'd say take it honors with Adena."
2073,Fun class... take it with friends... she's very amusing
4234,"Professor Wolf was ok.  I took advantage on the fact that it was a pretty easy class and I didn't study that well for it and received a &quot;C.&quot;  So, I re-took this class to boast my GPA w/ Professor Poms during the summer. Let me say, take it during the summer, this class is dueable during the 41/2 wks. rather than wanting to shoot yourself w/ Wolf."
4102,"Every single class begins with &quot;shut up&quot; and drinking from a water bottle in class is &quot;wasting my time.&quot; Never needed to look in the textbook, took a paragraph of notes all semester. Knowing the exact answer is necessary for tests. Take another professor or test out."
23,"Very harsh on participation. I    spoke everyday AND helped her correctly teach about the Iowa Caucuses and she didn't give me an A. VERY LIBERAL! If you are content arguing your views everyday, take this class. If not, find another class. The quizzes and NYT readings are stupid and pointless. Tests are LONG but fairly easy if you paid attention"
1027,"Randy is a great guy and is there for you. However, you may never know for sure what your grade is prior to the end of the semester being that he never gets papers back. BioTAP is very difficult, but also very rewarding. If you put the work in, you'll notice that you've learned more than you would have in a normal class. Completely project-based. "
188,Impossible to hear him during lecture unless you're sitting two inches away from him. Only way to study for his exams is going through the powerpoints and old exams. He likes to trick students on the exam so make sure you study well. Labs are a joke - it's all busy work. Better than bios 100
3519,"She is an amazing prof. She keeps you awak during class. She doesnt meed a mic so you will be able to hear her even if you are in the back. She gives you dense study guides, but they are really helpful. This class needs some work to get an A. Dont buy the book. She uses everything thats on the slides."
1213,gret prof.  goes beyond to provide help sessions etc.  good guy too
279,He is an amazing teacher! Super cool. STUDY THE OLD EXAMS THEY ARE ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME! He is the hottest most badass teacher on campus!
366,"definitely need to go to lectures to get a good grade, but he makes them interesting so its not too bad. im taking him during the summer and he said we have been his best class ever (meaning getting the best grades) so his expectations might rise in the fall. overall cool guy. definitely read and go to lectures and you'll be sure to get an A!!"
4085,"Prof. Lyon's lectures are very thorough and informative. If you go to class and take notes, you are not likely to need the book. As far as being rude when asked questions: He gets annoyed when people ask questions they could have answered on their own with a little effort. I don't see anything wrong with expecting students to use their brains"
3662,"I never had her as a professor, but I was her TA/proctor for BIOL 103 one semester.  I'm not sure how good of a lecturer she is, but she is super-friendly and her exams are really easy."
270,"Dr. Molumby is a great teacher, but you really need to pay attention to all the minute details on his lecture slides. He explains the concepts in class thoroughly and tells jokes at the same time too! He is enthusiastic at times and sometimes not. I would recommend him though because he has VERY detailed information on his slides."
1084,Holds review sessions that are extremely helpful. Overall he makes this a very difficult course.
463,"If you're looking for any EXTREMELY knowledgeable and enthusiastic lecturer - take this class! However, note that Dr. Capelotti doesn't cut any slack to his students, he actually expects you to WORK and spend time with the material outside of class. It's refreshing to have a professor who holds students to higher standard. If you're lazy avoid him"
45,"He shoves a bunch of html, Javascript, CSS, PHP, and forces down intensive computer knowledge down your throat.  He spits sizzling apple juice from his puckered lips and does yoga throughout class."
1170,Phillis is a great guy. He knows his stuff.. but thinks the class knows it too. His quizzes and exams are tricky... so go to the review sessions.. those will help... A LOT! Overall he's fun to be with..
4224,"She is worst, she has big attitude problem. Her class lond and boring. Her Exams are long, hard,and tricky exams. Her worst lab teachers make me nervas, treat adult students like elementary students. I lost all my mind and answers because of those Lab teachers."
1149,"He was probably one of the best professors that I have ever had.  Don't be fooled by people that didn't like him. They simply do not have a sense of humor.  He made the subject matter interesting and did a great job of teaching the basic material.  The fact that he loves what he does is evident, and he is very helpful.  Definitely take this course!"
1882,Amazing class.  Everything is very clearly stated.  The notes are very helpful and it is a really fun class to go to.  I took it at 9:05 in the morning and only missed class once!
3761,"Fairly easy class, just took it to meet natural science gen. ed requirement. Just show up to all the classes and you should get an A. The only part about this class I didn't like was the lab work. There tended to be a lot more lab work than was necessary, but other than that I reccomend this class for natural science elective."
4319,He is an ok guy but as a teacher he is not much help if you actually want to learn the material. I would NOT recommend him. His was the class i most dreaded during the week :(
3649,"very interesting, and keeps your attention the whole class. tests are straight from her notes which are straight from the book. has a review session for every test, and if you do well on final exam she'll drop your lowest test grade and use your final grade twice."
561,Great at explaining
969,Schurter is THE MAN. I've never had a prof who cares so much that the students learn the material and are able to apply it. Most teachers expect you to know the material for exams; he wants you to know the material so you can actually benefit from it outside the classroom. He relates to each student personally as well. I'd take any class of his.
584,"What a jerk!  I hate his classes, and I've taken chemistry all my life and he still doesn't make sense!  I got 90% in IB chemistry last year!"
2503,"nice and friendly, like him even i'm a man"
2796,"He rambles on about a myriad of unconnected ideas that we are somehow to understand and apply to construct sophisticated proofs. I attended every single lecture, reviewed my notes and took more extensive notes from advanced textbooks , and diligently showed up at my tutorials. I have never attempted to understand a subject and failed so miserably."
1780,Good guy.
1362,A really easy class.  If you get good grades on the first three exam you can just stop going to class altogether.  Very fun class and Tammy is an amazing teacher.
4030,"This is absolutely one of the worst professors I've ever encountered. The work is doable, although the homework has very little to do with the actual school work.  Most of the time he spends showing History Channel videos.  He has no respect for his students and talks down to everyone.  Your answer will never be enough or correct.  AVOID!!!!"
1698,Awful teacher! Doesn't explain anything that is on the test! Owls are poorly structured!  If you have to take this class go to the SI sessions you will learn much more there than in class. The only good part about the class is you can laugh at him when he makes bad jokes.
132,"hes funny and chill dude,grabbed few beers with him just get on his good side and its all good. wait you are here to study lol"
3517,BEST PROFESSOR  AT GMU!!! She is my inspiration. I started off at GMU with her class and she made it the best first year of school. She is very forgiving for the labs and she is a great lecturer . Her lectures were clear and easy to understand. Her tests are pretty easy but you have to study or at least read over the powerpoints. TAKE HER CLASS!!! 
1001,"Every single test and quiz is true or false. There are quizzes every Friday, but sometimes they are open note/mouth. Randy is a funny guy, he makes the class tolerable. There is not any homework, but make sure to go to SI reviews so you can fully understand what you learn that week for the quiz on Friday."
1020,"I liked him a lot, he really seems to like his students and enjoy teaching. He encourages critical thinking instead of memorizing. I did wish we had a slightly clearer way of study besides just listening very carefully during lectures, but for the most part he was great and I enjoyed the class. "
1350,"Tammy is an amazing prof. She is sweet as can be and is happy to answer individual questions. Lectures are well paced, easy to follow, and supplemented with little experiments and  video clips. You'll want to go to lecture. read the text, cause tests are not that easy. OWLs very easy. If you take PYSYCH 100, take it with Tammy!!"
1181,"Awesome teacher, makes everything really clear and likes to help students out.  He grades on many aspects so as long as you go to class you are pretty much guarenteed to do well."
1498,i want to bang hiM
3407,Easy class if you just study and do da green book.  I pulled out a B watch out for the project use the places website if you dont have info since she wants that and does not say. study and go to class and do hw and u will b fine idk y ppl focus on bad things deal with it its life jus study dats all you can do
838,"He is the worst teacher i have ever had. I love math, and i normally understand the concepts in math very well, but he just doesn't know how to teach. he doesn't show you how to apply anything, and what he does teach he teaches in the most round about and confusing way possible. do anything to avoid having him!!"
1536,"honestly the worst class ever,  easy class if you have taken any serious math class in high school. OWL is helpful, lecture is painful, especially at 9 AM"
2366,"Great lectures, funny guy and the term test wasn't too bad."
4334,Sweetest man ever. He is so nice and funny and just the cutesy old man extremely laid back east class you get alot of information despite some rambling but overall enjoyed the prof and the class
478,"this was the greatest class I have ever take at abington. Professor Capelotti is a great professor who knows his stuff, and isn't afraid to show it. I learned more information in this one class than I ever have in any of my other classes combined. challenging, but worth it all the way. I will remember what he taught me for a very long time"
1454,"Horrible teacher, has terrible handwriting, is always late to class, doesn't know how to use the homework website. Teaches the wrong material so don't be surprised if when you take an exam you don't recognize any of the material."
1264,"Tammy is awesome and it is very easy to get an A in her class! 4 exams, she drops lowest one. 7 in class pop quizzes, she drops the lowest one. And 10 online quizzes. With the extra credit, it is almost impossible not to get an A in this class. Plus she's funny and her lectures are super interesting!"
3741,She is really nice and easy but she is very boring in class it is very hard to concentrate but she is easy so it balances out. Also what the class was all about was mostly biology with some chemistry so if you cant do biology there are other classes.
1586,"Have you ever met a teacher who writes EVERYTHING down that he says&#63; &quot;Good morning class, today we will be talking about integrals...&quot;. Like we need something ELSE that makes math boring!"
3058,"This class was pretty easy. I did my work and got an A period. The exams are super easy. Great lecturer, dressed up as Harry Potter first day."
196,U would be better off watching paint dry. This guy talks too soft and lectures get boring. Come to class n get iclicker pts. One or two questions on exam is from lecture. Unfair exams. I skipped lectures and slept in class and passed with a B. ONLY way to do well is get old exams! And also go over ppt. Textbook is useless. He is rude at times. GL!
596,"Mr. Everett's English 1301 is a great class.  He explains grammar in a way that makes more sense than any of my high school  teachers' lessons did.  I finally ""got"" grammar!  He expects you to work hard and meet deadlines, but if you buy into the ""carpe diem"" culture you will do well.  He is always willing to help, too.  You just have to ask.  :)"
220,Dr. Molumby made this class very interesting. His stories and humor made it fun to attend. Exams however are pretty hard- get old exams! Read the book!
1532,please for your own sake do not take this class unless you have taken calc before you might pass
2144,great teacher! funny and easy to understand! great intro course!
538,"Overall, I wouldn't say she is the best teacher.  She often goes off into tangets, however she is as nice as they come.  She was helpful and not too hard.  Quizzes every class...so easy though! The readings are interesting too!"
857,"This class is very difficult. The teacher knows his stuff but he tends to go through the material too quickly. Also, he is out to get you on the exams. The exams are very tricky and hard well."
999,"Randy is the kindest man with great humor and he really does want everyone to succeed. He's obviously passionate about Biology and makes class real-world applicable. His teaching style is tough to follow, though. Take the best notes you can (struggle) and GO TO ALL THE SI SESSIONS if you want an A."
192,The class wasn't hard at all but you definitely have to put some work in to get an A. Studying powerpoints for tests is crucial. The sound system in the lecture hall did not support the size and it was hard to hear. Get there early and sit up front. His lectures are great and you can tell he's a super smart guy that's passionate about his field.
1278,Tammy is the best teacher ever. If I wasn't already a psych major I would defiantly been inspired to be one after taking her class. It is just introduction to psych so many things may seem familiar but it is very interesting and a great class. Tests aren't easy though(not hard either) you do need to study and put the effort in to get a good grade.
2825,Great professor. Teaching all the stuff you need to know to continue your study in statistics related program.

314,"Yeah, those are pure lies below. The story is that he'll teach you concepts in class and sometimes use book problem concepts in exams, too. You get an A if you studied the concepts rather than the trivial zoological facts he presents. Those facts act as reference points for recall. I've seen his wall-posted exam format for over 2 years. SHBE."
2095,Went off on his own tangents and would always use charts and graphs in class. It was kind of hard to follow along.
1517,"Is it a coincidence that so many people say he is a bad teacher and that so many people don't show up to class&#63;  His notes are clear and thorough and you need an 85 for an A, just show up to class and its a cake walk, no surprises on the exams plus you get a cheat sheet.  But you guys can keep blaming him for your own faults of not going to class."
2256,"Why did I even bother taking this course&#63;.  Didn't like it one bit.  I mean come on, all 100% multiple choice tests and exam&#63;  Pretty uselss i must say..."
1044,"Randall Phillis destroyed any love I had for biology. He is not only extremely disorganized but he also refuses to clearly answer anything and if he does not like you, will sass you in front of the entire lecture hall (did not happen to me, happened to a friend). Take any other professors class other than his. Do not recommend."
1620,"Randy is a great professor and makes the material very easy to understand. However his tests are difficult and test more on the application of the than knowledge.  His class 151 is great, however I would find it to be more difficult if I had not taken AP Bio in high school. Overall his class is good, his exams are just really difficult. "
3462,Dr. Fondufe is an amazing professor who enjoys her work and the subject of biology.  She always shows up with a positive and fun attitude and made sure we understood even the most complex concepts by providing several examples. She is very accessible outside of class. Exams are straightforward. She's is awesome.
4046,"I used to have respect for him, his classes are hard if you are still at NOVA level of doing work...but really its his attitude and the lack of respect he shows his students. I would respect him if he showed me respect, but recently he did the opposite (wasn't even in his class) Try to shake his hand and smile but I feel like he really doesn't care"
1483,"OMG OMG DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR MATH 100!!!!!! I took this class for an easy A, and he makes it harder than some of my upper level classes! The material is so easy, and so are the homeworks, but he makes his exams IMPOSSIBLE. What he explains during class (which is mandatory by the way) is nothing close to what he puts on the exams! AWFUL PROFESSOR!"
3922,She's amazing and funny. She made Art History so interesting!  She had this way of telling stories from the history of art that just grabbed your attention.  I always looked forward to this class and I will definitely take more classes with her before I graduate.  Her tests are no walk in the park but they follow the study guide. TAKE HER!
3771,Easy class and great teacher.
2259,Excellent professor. The class really changed my perspective on our world.
3413,"There is a lot of material to this course, and she moves throught it pretty quickly, which isn't necessarily her fault.  She has an aggresive demeanor which makes her unapproachable if you are having difficulty.  Just read the material, do the homework and ask the TA (Boe) for help..."
1642,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This class is by far the WORST class Ive ever taken at UMASS. He doesnt reply emails or put anything on Moodle. Lectures are the WORST in the entire universe and are useless. You really learn nothing but are required to know a ton of BS for the midterms. Its quite lovely... Dont take this class if you value your GPA!
180,"He's super cool and I really did like him. He's a really good professor and you can tell he's passionate about what he teaches. My only complaint is he talks really fast and mumbles a lot. You have to sit really close to hear him, but even then you still have to listen carefully. He goes on a lot of tangents too, which can be kind of annoying."
1216,"engages the class to talk & participate, not someone u want mad at u, yet fair"
2680,"nice, helpful, and has a sense of humour"
3134,schimmerling doest know how to teach and he has something stuck up his ass... he should stop teaching
2295,why does he try to be cool&#63;
1370,"She's so nice and she makes the class really fun and interesting.  Her lectures are interesting and entertaining, her notes are easy to understand, and her exams aren't too hard.  Lots of chances for extra credit.  Definitely take this class with Tammy."
1108,He's a great teacher. His method of teaching actually makes you think. Otherwise I'd be sleeping through the lecture with him droning on and on about whatever. But you really have to go to class though otherwise you will miss something. One class can throw you off if you can't get anybody's notes.
205,"His tests are way too hard and I really studied for them. I really thought I could get an A because I worked hard and got really good grades on presentations and lab reports, but no. It is very hard to hear him so you literally have to sit in the first three rows or you are screwed. "
3215,Hylton is a terrible teacher and extremely rude to her students. Only way to do well is do connect and try to learn from the TAs. Its sucks that she is the only teacher for acct 203. she is the worst professor I have ever had. If you can find another teacher take them! (Coming from a 4.0 student who got an A)
1038,This is not a class you learn out of the textbook for. He creates his own questions and focuses on critical thinking. He lectures like it's a small class and there are plenty of opportunities to ask questions. The discussion section is unhelpful but required.
3292,"Buy the textbook and UNDERSTAND it inside and out. The class isn't impossible just keep up with your work, do everything that's assigned ahead of time. Make sure you get as many points as possible on the 3 exams cuz the final is nuts. It's mostly you teaching yourself which sucks cuz I paid to be taught. Oh well..GL GG DD"
2348,"He was the one of the best chm profs. His tests might be a little harder than the other profs, but not much... If you do your homework, ask your questions, and understand the concepts well, you will do fine. very helpful, funny and clear. I loved his lectures."
4192,"Such a wonderful class. With the lectures all online and great TA's teaching the easy recitation classes, this class is fairly simple. Attend labs to do in-class assessments and def. watch the online lectures. So much extra credit available, it's surreal."
1398,"One of my favorite classes.. I wish I could take this one again!  Its fun and lots of group participation.  Very easy to obtain a good grade, especially with all the extra credit she offers.  Tammy is wonderful, and her kids are cuties too!"
93,I don't even go to Stanford. I watched Mehran's Programming Methodology lectures online. He's awesome.
2567,"Elisa is best at lecturing in a friendly way, and encouraging participation. Everything else is average. She does seem to favour the white students though - gives them a little more attention, remembers their names."
2330,likes to read right out of his text book that he wrote... easy tests
1434,"Take this GenEd. 4 exams,,she drops the lowest; 12 owls drops 2, 6 reading checks (short, you get half credit if you didn't read but write your name). You'll want to come to class;  she's all about activities and videos.  Easy A."
2934,No Comments
3404,"The material in this class is manageable. However, does require some studying.  Test are are average in difficulty, project is pretty easy. Very clear, concise, and tells you the important things to study for the exam."
2311,great
2587,Very Bad Teacher.
3238,"Avoid her if you can. Seriously!!! She randomly call on you and asks questions. If you don't have a correct answer, she will keep asking until you get to the right answer. Although I had B+ on the midterm and final, it ended up with C+ b/c of the project. She expects more than she taught, Creativity. I guarantee 2/3 of the class will disapear."
3430,This professor runs through material so quickly that by the end of class your head is spinning. She reads off the power point slides rather than explaining them which adds to the confusion.
1751,Much better class than math 127 and much clearer tests. Cook ads his unique personality to math somtimes making it fun and at other times it makes class very confusing. Good teacher that means well but you better be ready to read the text if you want an A
33,it was a total waste of my time....i want every minute back that i wasted in her class!!!!!!!!!! it was a horrible expierence and her teaching style was not helpful under any circumstances.
505,"Class was alrite, boring at times~ got a B"
3692,"The exam questions are tricky.  However, her passion for biology shines through her enjoyable lectures."
1611,So easy.  Basically gives you the test before he gives you the test.
589,THis guy thinks he knows everything... funny to hear him talk...look around the class 50% of ppl are sleeping now thats chemistry
3841,Amazing professor and I highly recommend her!! She is so funny and gets students involved in learning the material. I am not an art student by any means but this was probably my easiest class. 3 tests all based on pictures and knowing the concepts. No memorization of photos. Show up to class and take notes and you will pass. TAKE HER!!!!!!
721,"Art's great.  His lectures are decent, his labs are awesome, and he's always willing to help students when they're stuck. There's this kid in my class who is 3 labs behind and Art takes time to help him.  And yea, he's kind of soft-spoken. If you sit in the back, you probably won't hear anything."
2698,"One of the worst profs at the school.  Completely turned me off physiology (one of my favorite courses prior to this experience) Completely ignored clinical physiology and instead focused on tiny details that were not interesting.  His notes (yellow book) were messy, unclear, and lacked the foundation required for higher learning."
3689,She has the most extensive notes ever and is pretty helpful--but the tests are evil and mostly filled with &quot;which of the following does not fit&quot; type questions.
811,"go to EVERY class, take really good notes b/c most of his exam questions are based on examples in class, read the book. his exams are nothing he says it would be & the final is hard so u really gotta really know what the &quot;fundamental theorem of calc&quot; he always talks about is b/c that's what all his exams are about"
2138,"Although the lectures are organized, I was not fully convinced with all the facts he was presenting. Read the text more than once and it's useful if you record the lectures. If I could take it again, I don't think I would but that's probably because of my general dislike for the subject. Be prepared for no breaks."
2407,HIS TESTS ARE HARD. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU STUDY. BOTH 138 and 139!
1550,"doesnt explain things, very boring, just sits and talks and usually doesnt know what hes talking about"
376,"Cool teacher, hard tests.  He will NOT curve, (class avg on his test was under 50%).  Study his on-line practice exams, old exams, and his notes."
2025,good teacher
1721,No Comments
1499,"you can sign up for his class, make sure you save room for Calden's class. the guy doesn't take attendence. thank god because everyone would fail. i think he's clinically depressed..."
3806,"I loved this class. Her study guides are long, but worth going through them. She was very helpful and her class was fun. I guess people just want an easy A, but it is up to the student to make an effort."
1260,"Tammy is the best professor ever. She is super enthusiastic about teaching and engages everyone because she is a really funny lady and super radiant and awesome. This class is fun because of her, and I know that because I visited my roommates psych lecture with a different professor and I wanted to cry because I missed Tammy so much. "
598,"Great class!  Mr. Everett is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about what he does and just wants the students to do their part to make the class a success.  Be positive, work hard, and buy into the things he requests and you will learn and grow in the best ways possible."
731,He seemed a bit... lost at times. He speaks kinda softly and makes you sleepy. No problems to work on your own the double check in class. He just lectures and you sit there trying to frantically copy whatever nonsense he puts on the board.
960,"Professor Schurter is a great guy who is always there to help out with things inside or outside of class. His tips are invaluable, and he helped me land the position I want with some great interview tips. Take this class with him, you wont regret it."
1075,"You need to go to class because the clicker questions are on the exams, but as long as you question him you will learn a ton and he wants everyone to get the good grade but more importantly learn from it. An absolutely wonderful professor because he doesn't make you memorize, he makes you THINK!"
1051,Randy is a nice guy who really wants his students to do well. He does not spoon-feed you the notes or what he wants you to know - he expects that you are in college now and you will pay attention to lecture and write down what you think is important. If you take his class be prepared for his unconventional teaching style.
254,Great Prof! I would recommend him to every incoming UIC freshman.
668,He is very willing to help and gives very clear guidelines and goes over step by step how to do the assignments.
511,"One of the most interesting people at PSU Abington, extrmely friendly if you get to know him - don't expect a good grade if you don't put effort into this class! It's a lot of fun, but show some kind of interest. Capelotti is not only an excellent professor, but a really awesome person as well."
2880,"Interesting material, but lots of memorizing. You have to go to class to pass"
1800,"She's so great. Explains everything you need to know, and in fun ways, and offers a lot of extra credit. You can tell she's passionate. It's hard to do poorly in this class, not because it's easy--Whitbourne just makes a point you know all the information. Highly recommended for Intro to Psych!"
4361,ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE MAN!! so so cute...the class is kind of dull but he tries hard. The test questions are a little ambiguous but they're not too difficult. just read the book to back up his lectures
691,"GREAT TEACHER, SHE IS TRULY A SWEETHEART. YOU HAVE TO DO JOURNALS FOR THIS CLASS BUT NOTHING A 5TH GRADER CAN'T DO. IT'S A RESEARCH CLASS SO YOU WILL HAVE TO DO SOME WORK BUT SHE MAKES EVERYTHING VERY EASY AND UNDERSTANDABLE. HAVEN'T MET A BETTER PROFESSOR THAN HER AND SHE IS REALLY FUNNY. IT WAS A TRUE PLEASURE TO BE IN HER CLASS"
2331,"good speaker. * Btw, Brym did not write the entire text!!!"
2881,"He's an amazing prof. The class requires a lot of work, reading and all-nighters in order to get a good grade, but the topics covered by Dr. Tepperman are amazing. He's really passionate about social inequalities, and he transmits this passion through his lectures. He's also hilarious and motivational. I would recommend this course to everyone."
2957,"extremely intelligent.  may seem intimidating at first, but is very caring, and understanding.  Gives honest feedback in HELP, not to belittle.  SOC327 best course i've taken"
1815,"Professor Whitbourne is kind, interesting, & intelligent without being arrogant.  She wants all the students to succeed, & it's practically impossible to get a bad grade- unless you never do any of the assignments & never attend.  She uses powerpoints, skits, audio... something for every type of learning style.  She makes class interesting & fun."
426,"Good class. Puts notes on website, tests are fairly easy if you study well. TAs are good and labs are not too bad...relatively easy. He's an awesome teacher."
494,The professor is really fun and intelligent. He is helpful when needed and has a great personality. Need to show up to class and read whatever is assigned because you will be quizzed on it. Tests are tricky but the notes on angel are very helpful
351,"He's a really nice and cool guy. Really cares about his students. His lectures are great to go to cuz he'll keep your attention and teaches the material in a way that you will remember it later on. His exams are ***** hard. They cover minor details from the lecture slides & book. If you wanna learn, take him, if u wanna boost ur gpa, go w/ another."
2429,very nice *three thumbs up*
2684,Nice
4210,"she is an AMAZING professor! very clear, knows her stuff, and full of experience! lecture is actually fun! won many awards, and it's not surprising at all - take her if you can!"
1788,"Sue does everything she can to help students succeed. Make sure you attend class as the exams are heavily based off of in class examples, and go to the extra credit discussions. She does everything she can to make the class lively and exciting. Solid teacher"
2240,he's not bad but the book is boring like hell and he wrote it and his tests are freaking HARD you gota read all the details in the book for the tests...can't skip anything...
3744,"Class is pretty easy, mostly basic biology topics, some earth related stuff. very nice person"
862,Great guy all around.  Tests are very hard- mainly tricky.
1505,"Just don't take him. If you must, don't go."
4292,Visual learners should avoid him. He talks for an hour without slides or anything because he doesn't like technology.
800,it was god awful. Hes so old he broke his hip and we got an actually decent teacher. everyones grades jumped up until he came back and they all plummeted. he should stop teaching hes older than the dust in the air.
3027,"Great prof, he &quot;cares about each one of you.&quot; A little hard to hear what he's saying, sometimes."
810,Awful teacher! Doesn't explain anything that is on the test! Owls are poorly structured!  If you have to take this class go to the SI sessions you will learn much more there than in class. The only good part about the class is you can laugh at him when he makes bad jokes.
2534,very helpful but notes are disorganized.
2092,"He tends to go very in depth on every topic and sometimes loses the interest of people in lectures. However, I found all of his lectures interesting, and very easy to understand. The math components are simple multiplication or division. Overall I do not understand the negativity most students have towards him. "
2118,"Avoid this class if you can. I mean, Professor Brym is great. But, way too much material is covered on his tests. Some questions, no matter how carefully you read the book you will never get. Really have a solid understanding of core concepts to do well in this course. "
990,"Randy is amazing, he's considerate, funny and kind. His class isn't for slackers; you'll need to attend every lecture and discussion to do well but he's worth it. He takes quizzes weekly but he changes his grading if he sees people aren't doing well. He once missed a quiz day so he automatically gave us all 100%. He's great, take him for bio 151."
744,"His lectures were kind of all over the place sometimes and often the homework problems were different from the problems he went over in lecture which was frustrating. Get ready to read the book a lot. However, if you go to his office hours or the calculus tutoring center, he was usually pretty helpful. He is a nice guy overall and really cares. "
4012,"Many assignments (including project worth 40% of grade) graded on bb months after or never.  Found the project fun (a geopolitical simulation, you control information using concepts in class; group project). Lectures were ok.  Only 1 assignment uses textbook (used Google books). 1 assignment posted night before it was due! Tests based on lectures."
1041,"Worst class ever, there's no structure in the class so you'll never know what you're going to learn next. Every question on the exam is true or false based on how well you can interpret and memorize a diagram. I hate this class!!!"
1406,"Took her class first semester of my freshman year... I can't wait to take another one of her classes, but unfortunately they fill up so quick becuase she is AMAZING!!!!"
2606,Excellent course!!! Great professor.
2971,Amazing Prof!
2319,"not apporachable, and choices of ta's questionable"
1351,"Very good class. Definitely take it with Rahhal. She is a great lecturer. Offers plenty of extra credit and always tries to make lectures interactive and worthwhile. Attendance isn't mandatory but its very helpful and usually very interesting. Weekly OWLS, and four exams."
3928,"Without a doubt THE BEST teacher I have had in my entire life.  I took four classes with her while I was in college and they were the highlight of my undergrad studies.  Her passion is contagious, her lectures are brilliant, informative & clear and she's such a fun person!  Take all of her classes, you won't be sorry!"
1652,"This man is one of the more un-helpful, not caring teachers i've ever run into. He honesty doesn't care about his students success and Is terrible at teaching. theres better teachers and even though the material isnt so hard, he makes it near impossible somehow"
1621,Very nice person. Always there if you need help. Lectures aren't clear so you have to teach yourself a lot of things.
332,"Dr. Molumby is a great professor. He knows what he is talking about and knows how to convey it to students who dont know what an allele is. His tests can be difficult, but he has excellent taste in music"
776,"I've never had a problem with math until this class. Cook has the unique ability to make you confused about things you understood prior to the class. Very nice professor, he means well and tries to crack jokes to keep students entertained, but he just cannot teach. The homework problems are NOTHING like ones on the exams."
3471,"Tests in this class are killer, so make sure you take your studying seriously and be prepared for literally anything on the powerpoints to show up as a question.  Overall, Prof. Fondufe is caring and seems to really care about us learning the material.  But: DON'T SKIP CLASS.  The powerpoints can be hard to understand without her providing context."
949,Great teacher and makes class exciting. If you try in the class you will get at least a B. She's a total MILF as well which makes class even better
3451,"shes bad, rude, and very blunt....if you like doin hw and do all ur hw u should take her but if u like a prof. who actually teaches u the stuff befor u do the hw dont take her... i dont like her"
1891,"awesome class, she makes it really fun and interesting."
3848,WONDERFUL professor... kept class interesting with her energetic personality.  Attendance is important as she doesn't post PowerPoints to blackboard.  Provides study guides--exams are pretty easy.  I loved this class and would definitely take it again.  Gave me a new perception on art.  (textbook was barely used just fyi).
1210,"Excellent teacher, knows his stuff, how to teach it and how to keep the class very interesting.  Classes are not boring, and his exams are reasonable"
3659,she is really cool teacher. she really dances when she gives her lecture but i mostly go to class and sleep. no one really goes to class but she gives pop quizes and i think thats why anyone shows up at all. i read book on my own and got an A in the class so cant be that bad. but she really is a good lecture professor. ^_^
3218,"Tough class! The homework takes forever, but ends up being super helpful. Be sure to hold on to all of the handouts used in class. At least skim the chapter prior to class- you'll probably get called on. Hylton is kind of hyper, but she knows what she's doing and expects you to do your part. She's very helpful in the classes before an exam."
1397,"She was a great professor. Really funny. Told a lot of cute stories about her twins. hardly studied and just went to almost all the lectures and got an A, not a hard class. Kind of interesting too."
1739,Not a good teacher
1163,This class is a complete waste of time.  He doesn't teach a thing and tries to intimidate people by drawing names.  I find his teaching style extremely ineffective and the course in general to fall coympletely below my expectations.
2666,"good prof,however,it seems she only lectures the easiest concepts in each chapter, and that can fool you into thinking you dont need to do any work to pass the course. (you do need to work, but you dont have to be a genius to pass)"
3335,"She's a fast talker and covers her chapters really quickly. I learned most of the material by myself or in lab, but she is helpful in telling you what practice questions she likes/doesn't like. Just make sure you know how to do ALL homework questions and you should be fine for the exams."
783,"Great Guy, but its hard to understand what he is teaching; he goes off tangents and talks about the history of the math than actually teaching us how to do it. If you get Felipe as TA, it is HIGHLY recommended that you go to his SI sessions, especially 2 or 1 days before an exam. It really helps since he hands out review/exam guides."
4024,"Professor Lyons is indeed an interesting character to say the least.  However, his exams are extremely fair. If you cannot get at least a B+ in this class, he is not the problem, you are.  90% of the test questions are softball questions and 10% are tricky.  You might leave thinking you studied too much, but sitting here now with an A is worth it."
3131,"Trust me, avoid him at all costs. He will likely be the weirdest professor you ever have to deal with. His quote: ""If you haven't looked at the assignment, you are doomed. (*chuckle*) yeah you are doomed."" His exam: ""Write up proof of a theorem which is three-page long."" His exam feedback: ""You don't know what you are talking about."""
3670,Shes really a great professor. Her notes are direct so you dont even need to buy the book unless you want to study the charts and visual stuff.
3616,"Goes by the material way too fast, and having an accent doesn't help out too much either. I will say that her final was a breeze, as she took ALL the questions from the past exams in the semester. Read the textbook."
877,I hate Calc... and prof cook makes it even more confusing..talks like you know what he s talking about
14,"She's really great. She is funny, open and really interested in her topic. I really enjoyed this class and I hope that I have an opportunity to take one of her classes again. You have to work hard, but you really learn quite a lot!"
3708,she's alright
4178,"Not much to rate here, she basically just narrates PowerPoint slides. It's kind of like having an audio version of the textbook. You have to teach yourself a lot of the material but if you work at it, an A isn't impossible."
2307,"boring and didactic, his class was huge and he handled it badly."
718,this lady is great!!...take her class if you just need a group therapy session!  Tests are open book and you dont even need to read because everything you talk about in class is eachothers problems!
360,"Dr. Molumby is a good professor. He is a very knowledgable  person. I just wish he wouldn't allude to sex in almost everything while talking in class, its very uncomfortable. Exams are not hard if you study in advance. Lab reports are irritating though. Just make sure you attend all the lectures as you never know when there might be a pop quiz."
4098,"Lyons is simply an evil and horrible professor. who will try to make your whole college experience painfull and misarble. This teacher's spill over effect goes around the whole departement no matter which professor you take IT 223 with you will have Lyons (Slides, HW, Exam, Project, and turnitin.com) so you are stuck and you can t run away anywhere"
3714,"This is THE lab science for non-science majors. Largen is an easy grader, tests come straight from the review material she provides, lab is boring but super easy. Lab hw takes less than 30 mins/week. One lab report with the directions listed explicitly (super easy). Lovely person, easy class, highly recommend if you suck at science but need a lab. "
2512,"Good prof.  Funny, and not to mention REALLY cute, when nervous. :)"
1902,She's really crazy but it's funny! She comes up with exciting ways to teach!
1102,"Randy Phi was a terrible professor, rude to his students and not at all helpful when answering questions. I got a B in his class and the information was interesting but he's one of the worst professors I've ever had."
568,last year he made the exam so hard that only 52% passed AFTER the bell curve..well this year to compensate it was so easy i got 100
705,"A great teacher!! A lot of work, but enjoyable."
2978,"Excellent professor.  I took his course in 1997.  If you study, you will get a great mark.  I suggest making a summary table of all the viruses, as that will be much easier to study from, than from the lecture notes"
2722,He is probably one of the most condescending professors I've met.  I don't like his lecture notes and the neuro 101 book (written by him) that we have to use. If you don't have to any issues in the course I suppose he is around an avg. UT prof. But if there are problems he will make life difficult for you.
2991,BEST PROF IN THE WORLD!!!
2833,AWESOME PROFESSOR!!!!!best prof ever
490,He's not that helpful when it comes to tests and quizzes. There's lots of reading and note-taking in his class. Be prepared to write a lot.
803,"Here's the deal. If you took Math 127 and actually understood the material, not just did well on the exams because of the cheat sheet, you'll have no problem. He wastes his time talking about the history of equations, but the course material is not nearly as bad as it's reputation. Mostly derivatives and anti-derivatives. Just get it over with"
1061,"The semesters been over for almost a week and I still don't know my grade...exams are hard, lectures don't make sense, overall, I wish I took this class with a different professor."
2310,"Tests are hard, he is good but way to cocky"
2014,Awesome woman. Very intelligent and clear when explaining the information. Maintains people's attention with hilarious analogies and anecdotes. Very informative and interesting. PROBABLY THE EASIEST CLASS KNOWN TO MANKIND. Which is crazy considering I have learned so much in her class while having it be comparable to 2nd grade in terms of workload
2775,The worst experience in life science
1025,"Interesting professor, I enjoyed his teaching style very much. You need to go to class for Randy though, most of them are built off of the last lecture. Gives quizzes every Friday, usually scantron at the end of class but will change it up once in a while to do it during class as clicker. Loved him, wouldn't mind having him again."
3590,"STUDY YOUR SLIDES. All slides are fair game to the test (there's alot of slides). The book is very useful for studying. Her tests are have some easy questions and some tricky (all multiple choice). Cell Bio is mainly processes, functions, and structure. (alot of vocab). She's not a good nor a bad professor. She should be your &quot;default&quot;(I got a B+)"
3288,DON'T WIST YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME. It was an error for me and I wish if I believed my friends. you will learn nothing from her plus she will make you feel worthless. She has no basic knowledge of teaching  neither with communication ACC361 + Hylton was a horrible experience.
506,"Great professor. Class was sometimes boring, but he was funny."
393,"not fun, very hard! :( I'm not a bio major and it sucked!"
3794,Professor Largen is a very nice and easy professor. I ended up with a 97% in her class.
3855,"Dr. Bauman is one of the most inspirational people I've met at Mason. Her lectures are clear, fun, and I always walk out retaining 90% of what was taught."
794,"A nice guy, but a blah professor."
4048,"Prof Lyons is pretty dam smart, he knows his stuff.  He expects every pupil to be on his level of understanding. Lets be honest, this class is taught very much like a graduate class or a self study class.  They dont hold hand.They give you the work; and expect you to figure it out.THe homework is by far the most time consuming thing every."
2022,One of the easiest classes you'll ever take. Class is only helpful to go to for extra credit on exams. Dont buy textbook.
2688,No Comments
4160,"What a useless course. And this is required for business majors at Mason? What a joke. Money right down the drain if you ask me. Not to mention, the material is common sense yet everything is graded so harshly. I guess this is necessary though in order to make a common sense course seem ""professional."" What a waste of time and money."
2629,"You people are on crack, she is the best! If you do the work and go to class, your fine. I think she is amazing, I love her class, I hope she'll be teaching accounting next year."
1010,"Teaches concepts and application over specific facts.  Basically he wants you to be able to read a diagram and determine what would happen in a given hypothetical scenario.  No homework, no textbook but graded quizzes every Friday and iClicker attendance  every day.  He holds review sessions before quizzes and exams and will answer any questions."
843,"He spends entire classes deriving formulas that are in the text already, and spouting off about Leibniz and Newton. Hates cell phones, yet comes to class 10 minutes late EVERY time. Avoid this class at all costs, unless calculus comes easily to you- you will not learn anything!! Seriously, he sucks!"
1775,he actually explains what he means
2171,Brym is an amazing professor. He is clear about all information needed for tests and exams. He is very passionate about the subject and he makes you want to learn. I would definitly take his class again!!
1334,Best Prof. I've had. There aren't word I can use to describe how much I enjoyed this class.
643,Was very nervous about taking british literature but I'm glad I took it with Everett. His tests are easy as long as you put time into studying! I'd recommend him.
433,No Comments
2446,"He was a very good prof for CHM136, but as for CHM139, I didnl;t really feel he explained the concepts very well."
1915,No Comments
4288,"3 exams 3 quizzes. A lot of extra credit opportunities. Very into the class and knows a lot, but the class can get boring at times because all he does is lecture. Just read the chapter and you'll do fine on the exams. He's very nice and humorous."
1552,I kind of feel bad for him because its a terrible class.  He writes down all the formulas and never explains them.  Be prepared to teach yourself everything you need to know for the test.  I recommend not even really going that much.  Tests are very hard so get help! if you are bad at math either don't take this class or find a different teacher!
2778,"One of the worst profs I've had.Very monotonous, does not explain concepts well."
3617,"Quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever had, but better than other cell bio teachers. She goes very quickly, pretty useless in answering questions, and her exams are hard.  If you want to do well in this class, outline the slides and read the book. Going to class doesn't help at all."
2509,"Such a sweet prof! So cute and so nice, though teaching wise, he is not as good as Dicks"
1074,"Pretty cool guy. Studies flies, doesn't afraid of anything."
1477,"This is by far the worst professor I've ever had!! My high school teacher could teach better than this guy!  Homeworks have nothing to do with what we do in lecture and he has no idea what he's doing!  His exams are impossible to pass! If you have him, switch out if you know what's good for you! I learned this the hard way."
937,"Awesome professor. Really knows what she's talking about. Funny,classy, and engaging and clearly cares about her students. Tests are fairly tough but she prepares you as long as you show up.She does NOT tolerate any you-know-what and DO NOT show up late. Great professor; love her!!"
1752,"much better calc teacher than rudvalis (127). Cook is nice, goes over the material for a while. Tests are pretty easy, lets you use a &quot;note card&quot;  (although i actually used a sheet of paper folded in half, both sides + inside). Good calc prof!"
2789,"avoid him at costs, he prepare nothing for his lecture, and he talks of all kinds of unrelated topic on his lecture"
1510,"worst teacher ever, should never have become a professor."
1474,"AWFUL!! your just wasting your time and effort by taking this class! He doesnt know how to teach at all! I got an incomplete in the class even though I took all the tests and did everyone of the homework assignments.. He didnt bother to turn my grade in, then refused to answer and phone calls or emails.. Avoid this class if you can!"
3033,Very approachable and friendly.  Notes are sometimes disorganized.  Tests are fair but make sure you study the lecture notes VERY WELL !
1117,Very easy class but he is a horrible teacher.  I have never opened my textbook and still have an A.  Uses Prs daily and gives quizes every friday.
3296,"Her exams are NOTHING like the homework assignments she gives and what she goes over in class. She AIMS to fail you, so you would have to waste your money to retake her class. Lectures are pointless, U MUST GO TO RECITATION!!!! Final exam = BRUTAL!! She needs to be FIRED. Can we write a petition and get her fired please&#63;"
1593,"Worst math teacher ever, someone asks him a question to prepare for a test and he says, &quot;no, moving on&quot; Put the class down because the class avg. was 56 cause he cannot teach, do NOT take his class, he writes down EVERYTHING he says."
2753,super hard course.... super boring lectures...
4331,he is a horrible teacher! i did nothing to still earn a B. His test and quizes are all taken online and can be retaken as many times as you want. I went to class in the middle of the semester and less than 25 students were in our 250 lecture class. His lectures are boring and pointless. easy class terrible teacher
3776,"She is the best science teacher. If you put some work, you'll definitely can get A. I never received anything beyond C in science but I got A in her class !!"
1451,"Never bought the textbook, homework is online. Horrible handwriting, difficult to understand, review sessions are useless, unless you go to the SI tutor's reviews. Going to discussion also helped. Midterms are brutal, except the symbolics test, which was a breeze. More of a self-taught class."
3379,"Prof Hylton will do anything to help you out.  She may go over things a little faster than she should, but she makes up for this by explaining things over again if you ask her to.  I feel very fortunate to have had her as a teacher and a mentor."
330,"I breathed, ate, and slept this class. it was difficult. if you do not go to class you will fail.Prof molumby loves to use specific examples from lecture for his exams. His TA's suck so bad. Their horrible and their grading is ridiculous. If i knew this class was going to be this stupid i would have never taken it. His exams are impossible as well."
4325,"Gibberish. Spends a half hour on each slide covering material that is in no way related to the topic. He's a sweet man, but it just doesn't make up for his lack of concern for the material that we are SUPPOSE to be learning. And he has a problem turning his phone off so he answers it during the lecture which is totally unprofessional in my opinion."
1803,"She's very nice and loves to teach, and (for the most part) keeps it interesting. She has a bunch of different material to help keep your grade up (I'm not a great test taker). However- GO TO CLASS! I missed 3 in class assignments by skipping and felt it... just go! Learned my lesson."
3535,"Really nice, tries hard. Tough subject to memorize everything but her test are tricky!!! She will even admit it, very difficult to get an A I'd say impossible! Go into it reading the book and knowing you really need to READ AND REREAD the questions"
3439,Precise and organized. Tests are a bit hard. Students must put in 100% effort to do well in course.
1032,He holds review sessions every week which really helps clearing up small details that he just mentions in class. He really wants his students to understand and is willing to help out a lot. His tests are tough and his lectures can be confusing because he never really answers his own questions but its a great class. I would recommend. 
3245,"I have never been in a worse class. Her pace makes learning impossible. She doesnt explain the subject and makes exams hard. Does not care about concerns you have. I have had multiple friends go up to her after class about their issues and she is never helpful. For the final, she didn't allow us to ask questions for clarification."
2788,"The guy just doesn't handle noise very well, handwriting is a problem, marginally readable. The level he wants you to be is very difficult in his class, external materials will be required to do well. Basically he'll make really hard tests/exams and then just bell curve everyone up"
2250,for the massive size of the class (1500 students) he did an impressive job.
1361,"tammy is great. most of the test material comes from lectures, but u may need to read some out of class. good class tho!!"
2812,"take this course if u have a fetish for egyptian hieroglyphics (his notes), or have obsessive compulsive tendencies of or relating to memorizing asteroid formations in the kuiper belt (his tests/exams). if you like statistics, look elsewhere."
3000,I love this guy!
1115,"Despite the class being huge, he was able to get us to participate a lot better with the PRS. He uses the PRS as more than just an attendance device, and it really really helped me understand the concepts. And he's post all the explanations on the website for the PRS questions in case you missed them. Go to class, participate, and you'll do well."
2940,bad tests....... stupid questions
2951,"A wonderful teacher (refreshing for the U of T). This course however was not as interesting as I thought it would be. Prof Tepperman is a very interesting person, very knowledgeable, flexible in terms of meeting his students' needs, and an all around good guy, so he saved the course."
32,"She basically reads from the overhead for notes. Don't bother reading the book, its pointless. Her paper assignments have too many rules and really hinder intelligent writing. She treats the class like elementary school kids."
2091,Brym is an awesome speaker. His lectures are very in depth and his arguments are always strong. His lectures are very emotional (which made me feel angry and unjustified about social issues). He uses the most recent eventsnews to explain sociology concepts. Brym does not  read off the slides. He teaches students  to interpret data and graphs.
1488,"Mandatory attendance was a waste of time. I had to walk across the campus everyday just to sign in and leave. His teaching is poor, but the program he uses for homework, My Math Lab, is extremely helpful."
2103,Don't recommend. Tests are tough. Brym is boring. First lecture was on suicide! Adam Green was fine though. Very weird class.
1292,"What an inspiring person! Very interactive, makes me want to major psychology..."
755,"One of the worst professors I've come across. He doesn't complete problems he starts on the board and gets confused half way through them. He isn't clear in his explanations, class average on exams is significantly lower than the other Math132 classes,  avoid his class at all costs."
2850,No Comments
978,Hes very kind and truly invested in the students learning. He activly changed the grading policy through the semester so it was easier to get a better grade.
893,"dont bother with class, just do the owls"
3429,You need to study for her class. But she is livley and helpful. She really knows her stuff. She will go that extra mile for you if you show you care.
4022,"I have no idea how the other reviews can be so negative. Prof. Lyons is an excellent teacher with a wealth of information. He may seem tough during his lectures but he's a pretty chill guy in person. Also he curves all his classes by two letter grades, so you don't need to worry about your grade. Easy class, easy A!"
1860,"a thought i could have done better...she is a really good teacher, she has skits and movies and all types  of things to help u remember what she teaches...ps if u like being see participate alot and ull be in tons of pic in the end of semester slideshow"
229,Did not enjoy his class. He repeats a lot of questions from his previous exams but you do not know whats the right answer....very tricky questions!
4239,"Very good lecturer, fair overall. Some exam &#63;'s sucked...used discriminaters to confuse (note: I didn't say &quot;reinforce material & help us gain better understanding&quot;).  Lots of emphasis on cheaters, very disappointing to be treated that way.  Got the sense that we paid for previous experience w/ethics violations.  Otherwise, fine."
1861,"very nice professor, always enthusiastic, and treats students on an even level. Not hard but do go to class, alot of activities not in the book and surprise in class assigments. must study, winging it does not help, but its not hard to grasp, just memorization of terms/theories."
408,"Excellent class, recommend to everyone, so easy, lecture handouts hard to print from the internet (he does this on purpose so you'll attend class), but a great guy, funny and a big help when you need him.  Past exams almost identical to current exams, great study material."
170,"Not really sure what his problem is. He'll give you a problem solving question and will quickly mumble how to solve it. When someone asks him to go over it on paper, he hesitates and asks us why we couldn't just write down what he said. And he won't tell you what is on the exam. I've never had a class with such a horrible professor."
1973,Such an easy A and the class is very interesting. She puts all her notes online so you don't really have to go to class. I didn't even open my text book and still got an A in the class. Make sure to study and at least look over the test from last year. The homework assignments are pretty easy and I doubt someone actually looks at them.
4019,He is very knowledgeable. I really enjoyed his class. You will do a group project for this class where you'll be assigned a role. The project is a lot of fun and you learn how the real world works. Exams are pretty challenging. You need to pay attention to his lectures and take notes and you'll do fine on exams. There's only 2 assignments.

1957,"Judy is an amazing professor and sooo funny!  I wasn't all that exited to take Human Bio because I'm not a science person but I am so happy I did.  Her tests are so easy, as long as you pay attention.  Do the extra credit cause it's extra points on you exams and they're so easy.  Also I would suggest buying her notes at the textbook annex."
3021,very disorganized
1501,"Never take this class with this professor. If you can't get a different section professor, wait until you can fit it into your schedule even if it's next semester. He writes down every word he says aloud, he doesn't make the material clear at all and doesn't explain answers or how to approach a problem. He expects you to know everything already."
1746,"He is a very nice person but this class is rediculously hard, especially if you've never taken calc before. The tests are impossible and his lectures are all over the place."
4274,"Prof. Wolf is really helpful, and teaches with enthusiasm, and backs up her lectures with actual work experience.  She's helpful and fair with the grading!  Probably one of the better profs.  Take her for Teams and Leaders as well!"
3106,"Great professor. Genuinely loves what he does, writes *really* fast when pressed for time. Also, he chases students who leave class, lol. =)"
2505,"I don't know where everyone is getting the &quot;hot&quot; idea...he looks like Crispin Glover! But as a prof, he's an awesome lecturer and can make even the most boring parts interesting."
2121,"Ok, Brym is a really intelligent, precise prof. I found his lectures very interesting and stimulating. One of the only classes where i didnt find myself restlessly waiting for the 2 hours to end, it went by pretty quickly. I think he's a great prof, great guy, knows his stuff and is passionate about it."
676,"If you're a good writer and work hard, it may feel like an easy class.  But be prepared to work.  There's alot of reading required and alot of quizzes.  Also, he expects you to be able to back up your opinions with proof.  I learned alot from his class."
3898,"Possibly best professor at GMU. Took this class as GenEd but looked forward to it the most. I loved her so much I signed up for 2 more of her classes and ARTH is not relevant at all to my major. You will have to put in study hours and word hard, but shes very insightful & interesting. TAKE HER. Theres a reason she has 15+ pages of amazing reviews."
3918,"I love her. She is so direct and makes Art History so interesting!  This is my second class with her and I plan to take a third with her next semester. (ARTH 360)  I'm not even minoring in it.  Taking good notes and being to every class will surely get you high grades.  She seems like a picky grader at first but in reality, she is very fair."
4119,"[...Those that cant, teach] explains Lyons. His prowess to intimidate students through purposly convoluted lectures in an attempt to show his (purported) brilliance is unmatched. Since becoming a coordinator he has used his evil powers to subjugate rest of the instructors and extend his reign of terror to all IT 221 classes so you're all SOL."
4165,"Unstructured and unorganized, ironic considering this is a management class. Don't bother with her trivial online lectures, just read the book. Format changed since the summer, tests are all short answer. Recitation was pointless and unnecessary, but if you get a lenient recitation professor you'll be fine."
43,One of my fav profs of all time. Textbook needed if you don't have any CS or Java experience but otherwise the class is generally pretty easy. Lectures are recorded.
1116,"Our class had over 300 people in it, so when he tried to get class participation it was just the same group of kids in the front that would raise thier hands. He knows what he is talking about, but sometimes has to rush to get his point across. Class never ever ended on time. His grading was very fair and he would scale to help."
3078,"The professor is good, but he has a monotonous voice. I would recommend the class, but just be warned."
2781,"Worst educator I have come across in my life. I can think of a couple expletives when describing McDunnough. He really wanted to be anywhere but teaching. His lectures were so scattered, messy and did not prepare you for his exams, but the cherry on top was his arrogance towards all students. Good riddance."
4142,Lyons measures his success by how many students he can take down for plagiarism; a real nut case
1126,Awesome professor. Just take good notes in class and really study the material.
4174,"This class was pretty easy but its A LOT of memorizing. But, the concepts & expectations of the class are very clear. The online lecture a week is never more than an hour. 1 4pg max paper, 3 hw (4th is xtra credit) 3 tests noncumulative. Not all TAs are morons! I had Markin and he was great. Very helpful, clear & with great experience in the field."
4120,"I there is a section on Saturdays at 1130 PM and is the only one he is not teaching, take that section. Is that clear enough&#63;&#63;"
3726,Largen is extremely boring and so are her lectures. Most of the things I learned in this class were common sense. Final is really hard. Does give a lot of extra credit though and lab is easy 
2559,Sexy to distraction!
251,"Do not take him, his exams are hard and you got to memorize powerpoints, stay away from him!!! you have been warned"
2805,"The reason for so much complaint is not because of the prof; it is due to the nature of the material and the lack of mathematical maturity of students.(not students' fault either, mat137 is not theoretical enough to prepare students for this course) To appreciate his lecture, one needs to do some additional reading and mat157 is absolutely helpful."
3332,"Really hard, but I went and talked to her after every class if I had a question. I recommend taking this course over summer!"
912,"Love this professor! She is hilarious and very real. If profanity bothers you don't taker her because she does curse, but she's an amazing professor and passionate about criminology. She tells the class real life stories related to the topics and is really easy to pass, you just gotta be there for lectures which are never boring."
2404,good!
2526,he is the best prof ever...very sexy too!
1873,"Great class, great professor. Amazing amount of energy and interest in her subject!"
2600,such a bad proff. just reads off the slides. no point of going to classes. useless. not very hard but not a very good proff.
325,"In a nutshell, his class is nothing more than him trying to sell his character..you're into metal, we get it! Oh yeah and the exams are based on made up crap he calls to be his &quot;reasoning&quot; which ends up swelling our brains as logic starts fighting with us. Enough to make anyone hopelessly follow the leader..yes."
3113,"Really funny guy, love the class."

3687,She is nice
2189,Great course and prof.
869,Respectable teacher. Friendly and energetic. Not to good in explaining concepts. Couldnt get myself to focus on what he was talking about
1295,"Super nice teacher, quizzes and periodic in class writings. Both are really easy. The online quizzes sometimes give you incomplete questions/no context. Get a 6/10 and it's a 100%. Be prepared for hordes of swesty freshman, you will get sick. TA's are positively useless, uncooperative and unfriendly. Great teacher, easy class, terrible students."
620,"The Brit Lit class was my favorite class last semester!  Prof. Everett has put a huge amount of work into his lessons and it shows.  He is very enthusiastic about this class but expects you to earn your grade. He is very clear and organized and offers lots of extra credit.  If you do your part, you will really, really enjoy this class!  :)  "
1128,I was really looking forward to Bio 100 but he killed it for me. He is a great funny guy but when it comes to teaching he's not that good. His tests are wicked confusing and hard. The only way you can study is by the PRS questions and notes on-line. There are quizzes every firday drops the lowest 3.
2496,"Great Prof. I love the way he teaches, makes everything every clear"
2554,An ideal prof.
2196,excellent!
3038,very good prof.... lots of jokes!!
1744,"very nice guy, but the lectures are very confusing, and the exams are tricky"
3836,"Just get her notes, study the book study guide questions and you are on your way"
99,"best teacher of computer sciences i have ever taught by,"
4188,I loved this class. The online lecture lets you do the class on your own time and then you attend an hour 15 min. recitation once a week. Lots of extra credit opps. David Geller is an awesome lab professor. Very little busy work. The material is like applied psych. Tests are a breeze if you read the book and watch the lectures.
3753,"She is awesome and funny! For lecture, she takes attendance with iclicker. Lab is too long and way too much busy work, but what can you do... Easy A because she offers plenty of extra credit opportunities and is very helpful."
751,"Cook is a really bad prof. I had never taken Calc before, I attended every single lecture and took many notes. However he repeats the same lecture over multiple times and there were things on exams he never taught in class. He spends more time taking to his calk (literally) and reciting Shakespeare than teaching calc."
3390,"Not a really hard class, but good.  Paying for the book blows, but the class is an easy A if you show up and look at the book.  Take the section with the lab the same day so you're forced to do the homework before you show up."
2474,"Great guy overall, you can't go wrong with him!  Loved the Bush-bigfoot comparison!"
3586,"AVOID THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY GRADE; Fondufe is a fantastic example of a 100 level class with 300-400 level difficulty. Biology may be her strong suite, but it won't be yours if you're looking for gen ed requirements. If you are in 103 or 104 take another professor for better clarity and more ease; this will be a headache!"
657,Great instructor! He was great about giving feedback on all papers and explained everything in clear language.  He took time to help when needed.  Took this class online and will take the next one with him on campus.
495,"Great professor and very intelligent. Very helpful, but you have to ask for help. Tests were hard but if you study you'll do fine. I got an A-, Great guy to have a convo. with."
3704,Such a long boring class. Easy way to get credit for science with lab tho
2955,"Good teacher. However, constantly makes references to the holocaust. Tends to stifle debate within the class."
1187,He is knowledgeable and keeps class interesting but doesn't answer questions clearly. The exams were difficult.
1228,He wears the greatest shoes!
2195,"I'm an Engineering Student (ELEC OT5 + PEY), SOC101 was an elective I took, and man is that junk boring. Don't take his course as an elective. I have never taken a course as useless as SOC101!"
501,"This class is a joke. Calling it American Studies and then studying European Polar exploration is a joke. The topic is so boring. It nothing to do with the actual evolution of American Society. I don't know how this man is still allowed to teach this falsely advertised class. He is extremely bias on the topic, don't take this class with him."
4377,"he gives LOTS of extra credit; even though his lectures do not make much sense, i say, if you want an easy A, fill out his study guides, take advantage of extra credit, and study study. =)"
3997,I had heard a couple bad things about him but taking 366 over the summer online with him wasn't bad. It is mainly about self study but his lectures were helpful. He was also accessible via email. My only complaint was that we didn't get any grades back until almost the end of the semester. Know all of the study guides for midterm and final to pass.
4070,"I took this professor for 353, 492, and now 493. For 353 it was a professor switch and I was terrified after reading all the ratings. However, Professor Lyons is a WONDERFUL professor. You really learn a lot from him. This is college people, and he isn't here to baby-sit you."

1490,"I went to class for the first week, and for 2-3 classes before each midterm and final to hear the review. I just followed along in the book and did the OWL homework (which you can do as many times as it takes) and I got an A. You can bring a cheat sheet to the midterms/final, and they're multiple choice. Great way to get rid of a gened."
2119,"This is not an easy class. He will trick you with some pretty tough MC questions. Read the text CAREFULLY and more than once. The tests can require some serious, sometimes philosphical, application of course material."
605,"As long as you turn in all of your papers, try your best to improve each time, are receptive to constructive criticism, and give this class your all, you will do well.  Mr. Everett is very passionate and expects his students to meet their potential."
4278,"There is something really special in the way this professor gives lectures. While it sometimes goes WAY off the wall from the subject material, you can truly tell he loves what he teaches. His tests can be sort of tricky, but aren't impossible by any means. Overall, a good class, just old school teaching and grading wise."

4122,He is one of the most incompitant professors.  His temperment is better suited to teaching elementary school.  His lesson plans are convoluted purposefully to create as much confusion as possible.  His tests are geared to force mistakes by making you answer 1 q per minute.  He will yell and berate you.  Clearly unprofessional.
3315,She talks entirely too fast to allow for comprehension.  Disinterested in helping students and difficult to reach after hours.  BOOOOOOO

4398,His lectures jump around and don't correspond with the exam much.  He is late a lot and just talks the whole time.  There are no visual aids or power point.
4084,"Lyons is a good teacher. He was my instructor for IT 223 and IT 353 and I will take him for any other security course I need. He is very knowledgeable in what he teaches and if you show that you are serious about his class, he will treat you fairly and help you if he can. The project was fun but needs a little fine tuning."
2532,leslie is that you who wrote the comment about the water&#63;! lol...funny prof.
829,"Worst Teacher. TA test reviews do not help and if you approach Prof. Cook for help, he does nothing for you. Read the book, SI sessions help. Everyone fails that tests, but you should end up with a C if you do the owls."
174,"If you're self-taught, this is probably a good class/teacher for you. You won't be able to hear any of the lecture unless you sit in the front row. The class is super test heavy--you need to remember every official Latin name of every species he mentions or you won't pass any of the tests. Don't expect him to be coordinated with the TA's at all."
4069,"Good Teacher. Comes across harsh and difficult, but just wants students to learn the material. I had calculated my grade as an 87 but he curved it up to an A+, so he does curve the midterm and final!!  I studied for this class and another class the most, but that other class gave me an A- as the final grade and I had the second highest grade."
2550,Great guy - Yeah&#63;
217,"I don't know why everyone says this guy is so tricky on his test questions. If you show up for lecture and pay attention they are not that hard, and he gives you old tests and puts his slides online. Maybe he's tricky for all the people who talk endlessly through his lectures. Seriously, the mic thing wouldn't be an issue if people would shut up."
807,"Thurlow is a nice man, but he simply cannot teach. Use the book and do the practice problems. You should still go to class though, he goes over problems."
2610,"Course seems easy at first, but gets progressively harder as year progresses. The final exam is hard."
2927,"His lectures are not helpful at all since all material on the test are from the textbooks. The test focus too much on statistics making it hard instead of actual concepts of the course. The textbooks(which he wrote)are boring and expensive and not used next semister,so hard to sell. All said, course=expensive,boring,difficult for the wrong reasons."
1173,He was an awesome teacher! He helps you out in anyway he can. His tests are kinda a hard but its exactly whats covered in class. He gives you no surprises on the test. Very helpful during class. Gives a lot of review sessions for the test. I recommed very much taking this class with him.
1684,This man is a horrible professer.  He is useless when it coems to extra help or getting questions answered and he is horrendous at teaching.  Might as well not even attend class. Waste of time.
567,"What, is the guy stuffing his own ballet&#63;!&#63;!&#63;  Pompous, arrogant and uncaring.........nobody at the school is gonna miss you when your contract is up bud"
4075,AVOID AT ALL COST!!!  He has a TON of built up anger and he indiscriminately lashes it out at students. Lyons is the textbook case of an antisocial **** who can't cut it in the real world so he hides inside the walls of academia and gets off on belittling students. GMU's IT Security program will continue to suffer until they fire him.
3912,Professor Bauman is great! Her lectures are so enjoyable. She takes such boring topics and makes them interesting. I still remember the information i learned in her class! No textbook required.
1743,"this class is insanely difficult b/c he goes over things way to fast, and fails to explain them unless you constantly ask.  It is good cuz no quizzes, which means you dont have to do if you dont want to.  Get a tutor and youll be allset."
1740,"He is a really nice person, but his lectures are not helpful at all. in order to do good in his class u must teach it all to u'r self. even then his exams are rediculously difficult. he is out to get u on the exams. i would avoid him at all costs."
1180,"freshmen should becareful about this class, expect to read the materials he assigned throughly!!, even though the tests are multiple choices, but they need you to apply your knowledge about biology. this class won't be a burden if you read and study!!!"
1313,Tammy was one of the worst professors I have had at Umass. Very nice woman and a very entertaining class until one of her TA's lost my exam and then accused me of leaving with the exam in my hand. I talked to Tammy about the situation and she also accused me of leaving with the exam. I had to retake the exam. Knowing that I did better on the last.
3064,His lectures do not make sense. Do not take his class
2518,"he kicked ass, he knew his chem amazin and it didnt help that he is such a cutie"
4293,"This class was painfully boring - as a soc major I really wish they would let a new professor teach the raceethnicity course. But, overall it was an easy class. Prof. Dennis is very kind and has a lot of experience on the topics we covered. "
3392,"Good professor, I recommend taking the 3 hour class instead of the 1 plus lab. Much easier, and she is more flexible here. Exams are easy if you pay attention to what she tells you is going to be in the test because it will be on the test! Plus attend the review sections. If you do that you pass with little studying. I did!"
2354,"If U want to do well on his exam (and others) make sure that u understand every concept that he teaches, also work on the hardest tutorial questions and make sure U can do them easily. his questions aren't easy, but not impossible to do. work hard and you will get very good results!"
618,"American Literature II is an awesome class!  There is a bit of reading, but he tells you EXACTLY what will be on the tests beforehand and they are pretty easy if you study hard and do all reading.  His lessons are long and super-detailed, but very interesting if you do your part to focus and participate.  I would recommend this class!  "
576,do not like him at all!!
3749,"If you're looking to just get the lab science credit out of the way, this is the teacher to go with. She's very nice and the class isn't too hard. The lab isn't too tough either, but it's VERY time-consuming. Do recommend if you want an easy A."
650,"I had a good experience with Mr. Everett. His class is certainly not an easy A -- you'll work for a nice grade -- but you will definitely learn from his criticism. He's pleasant and definitely not boring; I learned a lot from his lectures. I will never use a conjunctive comma when there's not an independent clause on both sides, that's for sure!"
4000,this class is like trying to smell the number fourteen
156,"Really bad professor. A lot of the stuff he says during lecture have nothing to do with bio and are a waste of time. His tests ask very specific questions. Powerpoints are all over 100 slides and you have to know everything for the test. On top of his terrible teaching skills, he's very ignorant and thinks he's right about everything."
1094,Great Professor!  He challenges his students to think in ways we are not used to.  This will definitely help us in the future biology classes.
2453,He thinks he's so funny but he's NOT!  And he has issues with his hair
1832,I definitely recommend this class! She is very enthusiastic about every thing and makes the class interesting. There are only three tests and then homework online that is not hard at all!
1778,"Doesnt prepare you for the tests well, but they arnt made by him..."
1056,WORST teacher ever. He didn't explain clearly and rushed. Tests and quiz's are T/F questions. I was left in the dark not knowing what was going on and I didn't know if what I was thinking was right. He never posted graded quiz's so you don't know what you have in that class until grades areposted at end of semester. Don't take this class with him!!
1723,"Extremely unclear, never gives example problems. The material is not too hard but he makes it very confusing. He's not a bad guy, but his class is very boring and going is a waste of time. He may know what he's talking about, but no one else does. Help sessions w/ the TA's will save you though...but I would avoid him if possible."
293,"He really took the fun out of the subject for me.  His lectures seemed interesting, but he couldn't control the class long enough for anyone to HEAR it--300+ people talking over him!  If you have a strong background in this subject and a study group--you'll be fine.  If not, you'll have trouble.  His exams are difficult if you can't hear in lecture"
833,No Comments
95,He re-engineered our interests in CS again. I am addicted to his lectures.
1071,"This class is easy, but not what I wanted from a biology class. Randy genuinely wants his students to do well, but he has a strange teaching method - he tries to teach logic instead of biology. Test questions usually pretty clear, but rarely gives a straight answer during class."
1760,Nice guy.  Bad Teacher
240,"He is hard to follow during lecture because not only does he refuse to turn up the microphone (if you're not sitting WAY up front, you WON'T hear him), he goes very fast through the important slides and always goes off on tangents that do not help with the understanding of the material. Plus, he likes tricking people with the iclicker questions."
3349,Prof. Hylton is a great professor. I have learned a lot in her class. She knows her material well.
3408,Hylton is the best accounting teacher out there. I dunno why everyone thinks she's mean. She can be a bit anal but its usually for a good reason. She does go fast through info but I'd still think she's very straightforward with what she expects.
1491,He is dull and writes novels for us to copy into our notebooks. Don't put this class on ur schedule. U'll need to take Adena Calden's class. She'sa lot younger and laid back and is more helpful. Gives u tricks and tips to make things easier. I got an F w/ him.. had to retake it and got a B w/ Calden. P.S. I highly advise getting the TI89 Calculator

2649,"Practice is very important in the course. The more, the better. Lectures aren't anything you can't find in the textbook but the class discussion is important. Professor has a sense of humour and is nice and helpful."
4134,"Actually a pretty good teacher but its a lot of work. The cryptography project is insane.  He will tear it apart, however, gives you a reasonable grade.  I went to every class and got a B. My friend missed the last 7 classes and got a C+. Go to class, do the homework, and start the project no later than 6 weeks into the course."
353,Best guy ever! love love love his class funny as hell! first professor that actual cares about his students!
759,"He isn't bad at all. He's a joker and a half and he tells you what will be on the exams. If you go to class and do the pactice problems in the class, you'll probably get an at least a B+"
856,"very nice guy, but the lectures are very confusing, and the exams are tricky"
3625,she is excellent professor. just read the textbook.(questions come from the book) i would recommend going to class b/c it is really helpful. if you listen to her carefully(which is hard) and jot down what she says it is extremely helpful. remember to print out ppt before going to class. just dont read book try to understand it and you will have eas
2110,"What a course! What a prof! This course got me into sociology. Brym is clear, concise, straight to the point. It's an intro course, so of course you will use your textbook a lot. He DOES put info into lectures that is NOT found in the textbook, and he DOES use it in tests. This course opened my eyes and my mind."
465,"He isn't very helpful, he doesn't review anything. All the class is, is tests, so even though attendance isn't mandatory, it's better to go, even though it doesn't help anyway. The syllabus even says the average for his class is a C/D, I wouldn't advise taking his class."
1938,"course notebook, attendence bonuses, movie clips"
3036,Good teaching of difficult topic
3967,"Awesome professor!! Actually makes you want to learn this stuff!  Very easy going, understanding, and humorous.  Those moments she's full of caffeine are classic haha I wish more professors were like her. You will not regret taking her class.  Just listen, take notes, and memorize what she puts on the study guides."
1569,hes so boring i cant stand to listen to him for even the lousy 50 minute classes. he writes everything down which makes taking notes impossible and doesnt make any sense. i suggest making friends with some math major and studying with them.
888,"One of the most interesting teachers I've met.  He really knows his stuff, no matter what he's talking about.  I think he's a really good teacher."

29,"My CC profs grade easier on papers than she does, and they do not grade easy at all. She grades too hard on participation...I answer questions way more than most people and only got a B for participation. Tests aren't too hard, though."
3550,Oh cell bio. The class was fairly difficult and there are NO STUDY GUIDES for 213 so beware. You definitely should come to class; she is an interesting prof with an enthusiastic teaching style. The tests are pretty difficult so get used to studying hard for them. Take her if you really love cell bio a lot. Otherwise...find someone else.
2776,argh!
2694,Greatest
2276,"Good course, a real eye-opener.  I thought Brym taught it pretty well too, though the tests stressed too much memorization as opposed to understanding."
177,"If you have to take Bio 101, take Molumby. If you never have to take a biology class take Bio 101 with Molumby anyway. He is an amazing professor. He brings the subject matter down to an understandable level and at the same time makes it enjoyable and even humerous. His tests are designed to test your knowledge rather than just your memory."
2415,"browning is a good teacher but like everyone else said, his tests are 100x tougher than textbook questions. if you take his class, be prepared"
2378,He explains concepts pretty clearly and he usually gives a quick summary of the concept after a more detailed explanation of it. The slides are pretty empty - you have to take extra notes. All in all a pretty good prof.
4007,"If you pay attention in his class, you could do well. The only thing I, and I think most other students, had trouble with, were the pop quizzes. So just make sure you know the material because he wants specific answers for those. For exams, they aren't actually hard if you go through and know everything that is on the study guide. overall, not bad."
4298,"This class is a really boring class, the professor just keep talking and if u decide to slack off, it might affect your grade a little bit. Since some questions on the test was not included on his study guide, you basically need to listen what he said in the class.  The exam is somewhat hard if u didn't listen what he said in the class."

1175,"He has a very different style of teaching that can be difficult to get used to, but it is worth it.  He discusses many real world issues as they relate to bio...we started out the year with stem cells. He runs excellent review sessions if you ever get lost and is really enthusiastic about his class."
3001,entertaining prof
3380,"ever one says she is hell and her class is so hard. however, I thought that it was helpful taking this class with her because she teaches all the basics of accting. if this is your major she really helps you."
73,woooh
445,"Ok, overall his class was really INTERESTING. But first three exams are nothing like what he teaches you. At one point, both of the 21's were talking about what to do because everyone was failing. DO NOT skip class because you wont pass the final exam. However if you write down everything in the powerpoints youll be ok"
4100,"This guy is a S of a B or (SOB) if you know what I mean.  HOLY CRAP!  He thinks he can bend space, he think the universe revolves around him!  He thinks that he can write his own god damn formatting and call it MLA or APA.  This guy needs to either get FIRED or deported back to Australia"
1113,"If you want to learn biology, don't take his class. It's not an introduction to anything. He speaks as if you know everything already and he's totally incomprehensible. Oh and the labs were really ridiculous. Termites don't teach you anything. And really, teaching us the scientific method in college is a bit late. If you dont know it yet, you wont."
2131,a very interesting and engaging professor
2992,Best Prof ever!  Very helpful always at anytime.
30,"Its seems that her upper level classes are much easier than her lower level classes, i.e POLS 120. She focused on main events and really engaged the class in discussion. Grading was not that hard...however, she does grade papers like an English teacher. No need to buy text book as she gives you everything you need to know in class."
2236,"if i had a choice, i would drop the damn ****ing course.  i learned absolutely nothing new in it"
3047,"He as a resource was completely unhelpful. TAs didn't seem to know what was going on either. His tests tend to be almost exactly the same, so check previous terms' tests. This was the first science class I'd ever been in where the entire lecture hall unanimously responded &quot;NO&quot; when a professor asked, &quot;Did that make sense&#63;&quot;"
3081,"Took summer course. Had only ten people in the class. He was very funny, and always very friendly and helpful."
1034,"DO NOT TAKE RANDY'S CLASS. I should have listened to the rate my professor comments before this but I didn't, it was a huge mistake. You're expected to learn from sample questions that he doesn't explain. I have friends in 3 other bio classes who are all doing just fine and their exams are much more reasonable. DO not take this class "
52,The best prof through whom I could learn online 
402,He is the most down to earth guy with a great sense of humor though he WILL put you to work.  His class is not easy but you will learn a lot about biology.  Highly recommended for biology/biochemistry majors...
1437,Awesome professor! She's so much fun and full of energy. Also very funny and she makes it so that you actually WANT to go to class!
1905,"If you ever have the opportunity to take her class, do so! She is an amazing professor and I learned so much from her!  It was the first TUTH 930 class that I went to all the time! She mixes up her teachiung style to keep all interested! Shes amazing"
436,"He was nice, sweet and pushed me tho think in a whole new way!"
1402,"Best professor I've had at UMASS. Wicked funny, never a boring class. Relates everything to sex and drugs. Easy to get a good grade. Don't know one student who didn't love her. TAKE THIS CLASS!!"
1189,"For the most part, this class is so interesting and not boring at all. He models the tests and quizzes after the PRS questions and lectures- so if you miss class (which you shouldn't cause there is attendance), make sure you copy someone's notes."
4049,"You cannot really avoid Lyons if you are a security major, Heres my recommendations...you have to do well on the HW's thats mandatory  I'm talking at least 85%...only gave 1 quiz this semester and both midterm and final ARE HARD...try to at least get 50% on those..he curves the midterm and Final..."
2803,"If you don't have the background, dont take the course.  This is not an applied course.  It is supposed to be theoretical, and if you are mature enough to handle it, McDunnough does an excellent job!  Don't listen to these other people.  Just put in some effort and attend lectures."
564,Me too
1738,"Very good personality, but if you have no idea or interest in math, you will find the course very difficult.  He is an intelligent man whose jokes carry the class more than his explanations.  If you do not want to spend time in extra help, do not take the course with him."
4103,"Don't TAKE THIS PROF.!!! I don't understand why he needs to make a 100 level so difficult. He is the most self-centered, mean prof. I ever met. He will deduct the points from your projects as much as possible. And we never get projects' grades back on time, which made our 2nd project pushed back for a month!!! JUST DON'T TAKE HIM, it'll be suck 4 U"
3553,"Class is more on the difficult side you really have to actually go to class because there are unannounced quizzes and you can get behind really easily. She does make the class more interesting but really getting into the lectures, but her accent sometimes was difficult to understand."
26,Worst class I have ever taken. It is a 100 level course that is taught like a 400 level class. Her presentations are uninteresting and do not activate class discussion or motivate the students in the course. I think we need to look at why this is the 3rd university she has taught at in such a short period. Her teaching style dated.
3410,"Beware, first test is very easy, but second test is a MONSTER. I went from a B+ first test to a C- overall grade after the second. If you go to class you'll learn better, but the subject is very boring. She does have an attitude about things. If email her she'll be like you shoulda been in class bye"

You screw up one thing, say bye to a letter grade. Take Someone Else!!!!!! I rather take KN251/252 all over again. Record his lectures or write everything he says. Luckily I memorized all his slides."
450,"He does not have the best reputation, however he is willing to help you, just ask. Take his lectures very seriously because they are 90% of the necessary information for the tests. I wish that he would post the power points on angel and give the tests back, it will be very helpful to study for the final exam. Not an easy course, but worth taking!"

3629,"Very smart, helpful and nice body for her age.  Just go to class and pay attention, print out the powerpoints, jot down info to clarify them when ur in class and go over them b4 the test and u'll be good. I didn't really use the test book cuz the powerpoints are available.  Some test q's come from the guide book so do buy it."
4283,"He's a fun guy. Love his lectures but not to learn just to be entertained. If you want to learn, read the book and fill out the study guides. Make sure you mark in test and quiz dates. Both are very straightforward. Be ready and youre fine. :)"
2647,"She's funny, but she's a typical reader (ie not teacher). Know the difference&#63; So better make your own notes, do your own exercises, and read your own book. Hard tests/exam. MCs r easy (LOL)"
1146,"Take it if your a bio major. If your not, avoid at all costs, it is soo hard. I'm an all A student and got a C."
321,Any person that rated this guy as hes a great professor you people are just weird like him. Doesnt help students at all. Tells you to read the book its honestly pointless and a waste of time. Heres what he tells you to study for the tests all of the 200 power point slides. Yea great professor. If you like boring lectures and no organization goahead
881,I don't get calculus and he isn't helping much!
1563,"he is a pretty bad teacher, but if you took calc in high school then the class shouldnt be too bad...hes very confusing in class though and writes down every single word he says. if you take this class, try to stay focused in lecture and do the homeworks"
655,"Very friendly and helpful, I enjoy having him as my professor. He makes brit lit very interesting."
4328,All previous reviews are irrelevant now that he has changed his curriculum. Everything is done IN CLASS and good luck hearing the minute details he babbles and sticks on the test. Study HARD. His class is NOT as easy as it use to be.

3229,"Worst Professor I ever had. Does not make anything understandable, does not try to make anything understandable, does not answer people's questions and snaps at students using laptops"
1029,"Randy is a great prof who loves what he teaches, however, he is very unclear in lectures and talks in circles. Exams and quizzes are all critical thinking tf problems that are confusing and hypothetical. The class was interesting but it is hard to do well on exams. "
3180,Great professor. I had her for 203 and 301 and would take all my accounting courses with her if I could. She's fair and efficient. Treats students with respect and prepares you for the real world. Students who warn you not to take her probably don't like her because she's you actually have to do work and have to apply your knowledge.
527,"She was a great teacher, and was very funny. She made the material be not as boring as it could have been. Be ready to participate though. She's really nice."
2519,An amazing prof!!
122,AWESOME GUY!
3007,Prof. Abouhaidar is an amazing professor.  He has wonderful anecodtes and an interesting way of teaching a virology.  He actually makes it fun!
3833,"Dr L is very fair, thoroughly covers EVERYTHING she will test on, and will spend the time to review anything with which you need help. Very pleasant. PAY ATTENTION, ATTEND AND PREP FOR LECTURES & LABS and you will get you an A in freshman bio as I did!"
44,Best Prof of all time

354,"He always keeps the class on their toes with his lectures. His tests can be ridiculous! Memorize his lecture slides, if you don't think it's going to be on the test... memorize it! His test questions sometimes are almost identical to the ones on the practice exam"
2562,He is generally a good prof.
3733,"Lecture styled class is boring. She was sick this semester and the class didnt even match up to lab. Book was useless, didnt even match up with the learning guides she posts as optional learning material, just google the information I guess?"
1580,No Comments
1898,she invovled the class in experiments and demonstrations.
1534,Rudvalis is AWFUL.  Listening to him is a complete waste of time.  And he's really gross.  I don't think he should be teaching.   No one should have to be around Rudvalis at 9 in the morning.
2370,"Browning is an excellent teacher, his lectures are not very fast paced and they are very clear. He should invest in a large molecular model kit though, to show students models in lecture."
2392,awful midterms
534,"I don't know, she might be a good teacher, but I guess I'm not good in philosophy. She's pretty hard, expects attendance, and her papers are tough if you don't know/care about philosophy."
4094,"so I was initially registered to take this class with Marchant,however she stopped teaching and I was stuck with Lyons. I was terrified, towards the end of my first week with him I was pleasantly surprised. He is a wonderful professor, knowledgeable, helpful, and very understanding. I highly recommend him, and will take him again. :)"
2342,"Course and prof great.Tests should have tested more relevant things,format hard"
1106,"Very funny guy (I personally enjoy the &quot;police reports&quot;), however his teaching style is very unique. Many times we are given questions to apply concepts he has not fully explained or has not explained to a suitable extent. Overall, very difficult class for a 100 class, but he is certainly an overall great guy."
1557,"this teacher is very bad.... i dont recommend going to class, you teach yourself and you have to take advantage of the tutors and friends from class to get together and learn the material."
2903,"Never ever ever ever take this course as an elective, don't even consider, especially if you are not ""awesome"" with memorization. He just talks about random stuff in lectures   and almost all the readings have to be memorized to get a decent grade. BroTip: don't take it, just don't..."
256,"This guy is the most hipster biology professor you will ever have. He seems like a cool guy and is extremely knowledgeable. Going to lecture is really important for this class. The exam questions come directly from lecture, so studying the power points is helpful but insufficient. Labs were easy, but lab reports kind of annoying for this class."
2053,easy gen ed but a fun and informative class too.
1345,"Tammy is the best professor I have had at UMass so far.  She makes everything very clear and wants to make sure everyone does well in her class.  There are 4 tests and she only counts 3.  There is also a lot of extra credit opportunities.  This was an awesome class, definately take it if you need to take psych 100, easy gen ed!!"
2077,"she's funny, but i hated this class. i had sex ed in 3rd grade, didn't need it again."
1589,"ummm  . . . yea, the entire class average was a 45 on the past exam, he didn't teach us anything! good luck with him"
2002,Amazing class..by far the best I have taken. Such a nice woman who really wants students to learn and will make it easy for you do well. She drops the lowest exam grade and the final is not cumulative. If you go to most classes and do nothing else you will get an A.
647,"The class was hard, but I did learn a lot. If you do the required reading, you should do well on the quizes.  If you need any help, he has an open door policy and is willing to offer all the help you need.  Wish all teachers were like Mr Everett."
1479,"If you get into a class with this man as the pofessor, drop it immediately and sign up with a different instructor, or just go to the other instructor's lectures since all of the exams are together anyways.  This is a horrible class."
2646,"she is nice, funny and approachable.. lectures are short and informative, but not very important~ Just remember to read the chapters and do the questions..."
3727,Easy
1178,not the easiet but will do anything to really help out and his demonstrations are awesome wso you want to go to classand you will do well
2470,he's gr8. fun to learn from. excellent guy!! keep it up...!!!! (Y)
2925,#NAME?
291,I really enjoyed this class; needless to say I had almost no interest in ecology before Dr. Molumby.  I really enjoyed taking his class! He's clearly super knowledgeable about the subject he teaches and he enjoys what he does which is definitely relayed in his lectures.  He certainly made class interesting and made me take an interest in ecology.
2096,always brings graphs and charts in every possible topic! this isn't a math course!!!

3824,"Ugh.  BORING!!Reads directly off powerpoint notes (which are posted online)Study guides are awfully long, tests are hard to study for... little details about a lot.  Lecture class thats huge - try to avoid if possible....Professor seems really nice - just sucky class.  Material is easy, class isnt."
3346,She isn't a horrible professor.  She just teaches an EXTREMLEY hard subject.  Go to every class.  Do all the homework.  Study the review sheets.  You'll be fine.
2875,"Pretty bad class in my opinion. Loads of reading, including a terribly boring book about ""Flows"" which he wrote. He didn't make the material interesting at all. The material was very easy to digest, but there was just a ton of memorization, which made it feel like highschool. Unless you know you love soc, don't take this class and avoid this prof."
1833,Great class. She made the material clear and was very specific about what to know for the tests. Gives 5 review points for each class-Know them!
1767,No Comments
2431,Excellent teacher. Excellent enthusiasm. Always available. He rocks! The best chemistry teacher at U of T!
263,best bio professor so far :)
3252,Best to do the HW and learn through that. Go to the class prior to the exam bc she takes attendance that class and points out things that will be on the test. Most help is in the recitation for the class. I did well all semester but failed the final but still got an A I think bc she curved it or bc she saw I had perfect attendence.
1485,(Calc 127) Class is soo boring. Highly recommend something to stay awake. Not very helpful in clarifying issues. Learn to use your calculator for exams. Exams are like 20 questions multiple choice. Easy class though if you know some calculus and know how to use your calculator. Otherwise...Boringggggggg..fell asleep all the time
4114,Worst teacher ever.
3910,"I cannot say enough good things about Bauman. She knows what she's doing - she is funny, energetic, keeps the class interesting, clear about assignments. She is not exactly an easy grader but she is always willing to help you w/the assignments. If you're not an ARTH major but have to take an ARTH class take it with her or Butler you won't regret it"
733,Very nice person. Always there if you need help. Lectures aren't clear so you have to teach yourself a lot of things.
56,"106A with Mehran, the best class ever. He's such a great lecturer and he makes you love CS"
1281,Tamara makes it hard to fail the class. Everything is rounded up and it is easy to do well on her tests as long as you study. Going to class is recommended but if you miss one the book will tell you everything you need to know. Definitely recommend her as a professor.
1770,hes the man kids
2285,"He's a pretty decent professor, but he is too high on himself & has too much ego"
3989,"awesome awesome class, highly recommend!"
680,Dr. Sacher is amazing! She's really helpful and funny too. It's impossible to not get an A in this class. There isn't a lot of work and the classroom setting is really relaxed and comfortable. Wish she taught more classes.
3043,"This guy goes to my high school in san jose. He thinks hes better than everyone just  because he went to standford. If he calls on you and you dont know the answer, he waits and humiliates you. If you have the wrong answer, he rolls his eyes back. Other teachers also dont like him. Overall, drop chemistry if you are going to have this teacher."
203,"Dr Molumby is awesome! I took him like 2 semester back and luckily I get to take him next semester for bios240. I struggled in 101 and went to all of his office hours and he helped me tremendously. I literally failed every test but he seen that I was really trying and I finished with a B. He is very understandin, IF he sees you trying. Cant wait !!"
1123,"Phillis was very interested in the success of his students and goes to many lengths to make sure there is a review before the exam. Attending class is important b/c it is more conceptual rather than being a class youu have to memorize stuff for. I recommend attending the review sessions too, follow his advice for studying b/c it works for his tests"
1665,"Good guy and teacher, people just hate on him because they're stupid and get bad grades..."
3181,"She's probably one of the best accounting professors at Mason. She doesn't allow any use of electronics during class time (or you'll get asked to put it away). She makes sure everyone understands the material by randomly calling people. If you ask her questions one on one, she'll answer them without you looking stupid. She's not that bad guys."
809,"First, Professor Cook is a really a nice guy and he tries his best to teach to 300 people.  Everything about this class will frustrate you.  OWLs are hard and sometimes not relevant to lecture, sometimes not relevant to the book.  Class will not help you prepare for exams very well so unless you're already great at calculus, you will not do well."
1572,This man is horrible. I don't know who allowed him to teach...but I would not wish this torture upon my worst enemy...STEER AWAY FROM HIM!
3199,She is the worst teacher I ever had. She knows her stuff but she does not know how to teach it! That's the problem just away from her class and take with another teacher you will do fine but if you don't be easy to fail
3162,Worst professor ever. DO. NOT. TAKE. HER. CLASS. Ive never hated a class as much as i hated this one. dont take dont take dont take.
682,"This teacher is simply amazing! Truly engages the class in meaningful discussions and she cares about her students...I've taken this teacher twice for a reason, she is one of MSU's finest. I highly suggest you take her courses."

2584,Elisa is the least effective prof in Rotman. She is lazy and doesnt like it when people question her. She basic reads off the slides and give you no additional insight. DONT GO TO HER LECTURES IF YOU HAVE READ THE CHAPTER ALREADY! She will NOT help. She also refuses to answer questions about assignments. Overall unprofessional and unfriendly.
1507,Terrible teacher who does not know how to get the material across.  Going to class is useless.  Avoid him at all costs.
3286,"I was scared when I found out I had her for the summer. Our class was small-I think she just hates big classes. She wasn't rude, obnoxious, ****, or mean AT ALL and was actually really patient and even funny. Take her over the summer-it's a lot easier and she tells you what to study for exams."
113,"Awesome CS teacher who makes everything clear, and wears costumes and funny vocabulary to boot. He works for Google and if you go to one of his Google talks he just may give you a free Google flashlight keychain."
2215,"Very tough course, interesting but tonnes of readings and difficult material."
286,"Lectures were very boring.  He was very mono and would always drift off topic.  Make sure you go for those I-Clicker points.  Labs were a waste of time, whereas they had nothing to do with what we learned.  Exams weren't that hard, but you had to make sure you study previous exams well so you are familiar with the questions."

1812,"She's really, really good. I would definitely recommend her for Psych. Yes, you must actually attend her class, but I swear it's rarely boring. There is quite a bit of homework but it is never difficult and it is very helpful. STUDY THE REVIEW POINTS OF EACH LECTURE. THEY WILL BE ON THE EXAMS."
1289,"She's cool . No lie . But damn , her exams are harder than calculus III and its just a beginner psych class which seems easy during class and study . I still havent understood the logic with her exams or grading . I hope she sees this ."
12,"I had her for POLS120 for part of my political science degree. I my have gotten an A, but it was the hardest course I ever took at Valpo...and it was supposed to be an intro level course (I focused on IR, so I never had her after 120). My CC profs graded easier than she did. She was constantly condescending to the students."
1090,"Prof. Phillis is an excellent teacher. He is helpful in clarification, clear in his teaching, and wise beyond the subject material. This class was much more than a standard Biology class for me. I highly recommend Prof. Phillis. His wisdom extends beyond the classroom."
1745,"This class is very difficult. The teacher knows his stuff but he tends to go through the material too quickly. Also, he is out to get you on the exams. The exams are very tricky and hard well."
322,"Molumby is a really fun teacher!  If you do the matierial, even if you get D's on all exams, you can still get a B.  He has a grade distribution where around 88% is an A and 76% is a B.  Interesting and opiniated teacher- strongly recomend!"
805,"The courses he teaches are the easiest calcs offered at UMass. If you don't do well on his course, even if you were without an instructor, you are a god damn shame. This course is a high school-repeat. Cook's understanding in Math is very profound. He's humble and also a great resource. I would highly question the work ethic of those who complain."
1867,"Very entertaining professor. Anything you might be confused about is cleared up in her lectures. She uses little experiments, life stories, videos, and PowerPoint presentations to get her ideas across, and tends to make things funny to keep your attention."
4018,"If you want to see rudeness of professor, there he go. I think he is very smart but He doesn't know how to respect classroom. Not only that grade post really late. Very strict about anything. If you are looking for easy A class it is not for you. If you are looking for serious class, there he is"
1340,Great teacher.  Very interesting and fun lectures.  She's kinda hot in a nerdy way.  Random writing assignments in class so you need to go to lecture.  Does a lot of interactive stuff.  Awesome class!
3878,Amazing professor. She's a riot and cares about her students and her class like no other.  She doesn't feed the class anything but encourages you to ask questions and figure things out on your own.  Gets the wheels turning in all the right ways.
736,"He doesn't teach anything in class don't even bother going. all online homework, completely useless teaching, doesn't help AT ALL. STAY AWAY"
1293,"Reasonable and easy professor. She had in class ""pop quizzes"" based off one of the books, but there's a calendar for when the quizzes are. Tests were a little harder than expected, but overall fair. She makes the lectures interesting and online quizzes are to boost grades. I didn't read the book not required for the pop quizzes and did very well."
3504,"Awesome teacher, cared about our interests & really let us decide what topics we wanted to cover. Class discussions were great! 1 page article summaries due every Sat by 11:59 which got really old, but they were so easy. Just read the article and cover everything in your summary (without your own opinion) and don't worry if you write too much!"
3133,"At first I thought he was a complete jerk, but after I talked with him I figured out he just doesn't know how to teach and is probably a little deficient in social skills. It really wouldn't be bad at all, if my grade weren't suffering for it."

2157,"Attendance in lectures is a must. Overall, content was interesting and very applicable to life. Tests were difficult but if you follow his advice: look at past tests, use online resources, it helps tremendously."
3682,"Some of her test questions are tricky, but just read them carefully and you'll be fine.  I never picked up my book, and hardly studied at all and got an A.  She's animated and funny."
1874,"Easy class, she made it interesting and bearable for an early morning class."
3663,Her tests are easy.. she gives a LOT of pop quizes like once every other week. teaches straight from the book if you read then you'll get an A. it's not hard reading either. i hate her pop quizes i get an A on every test but those killme.. i guess just keep up
3505,"I got an A by studying from her slides only. Attendance is not mandatory, but I'd recommend sitting in front so you can follow her lecture. Online assignments that can be done in short time ;). 3 Exams that are not as tricky as BIOL213 course, but there's somewhat a lot of memorization. Final test has a 100 multiple choice (50 from 3 exams)"
2543,he's sooooo funny
1073,"Randy expects you to write down every word he says and provides no notes or readings. His teaching style is awful, review sessions are usually unhelpful, no grades are ever posted and he is just overall mean and uncaring about students grades. He also never responds to emails even if they are very important."

4023,"Professor Lyons is one of the worst professors at GMU. I dont even know how he's still teaching with his rudeness, intimidation, and no respect to students. He's one of the professors to stay away from if you want to keep your GPA above a 2.5. You will thank me later."
2943,"This course is more challenging then most people expect. There is a ton of reading, and the tests are very tricky. Learn your stats and the small details. Go to Study groups - they help a lot and dont leave the reading to the week before the tests. I've learned my lesson and to make it easier for you, read as you get the material."
2643,"Summer. Classes r deceiving, minimal relevance to tests, which grill you on exceptions and not the rules, and in some instances went ahead testing things not covered yet. Read ahead, do all book problems/past tests. That wud b more relevant than class."
1055,"Randall is a nice guy, but completely unclear in what he wants. He begins the class by teaching logic, not biology. He does not communicate with his TAs on what he wants them to teach, so the discussions are basically useless. His lectures are somewhat entertaining though."
2233,A class preview- go into class and hear blah blah blah blah me blah blah blah blah more me blah blah blah blah wonderful me blah blah blah I luv me blah blah blah....(it goes on forever nonstop). At least his class gets you a good nap for the day.
3045,Most knowledge professor
2655,"I only rate &quot;one's&quot; across the board, b/c there aren't negatives!  She's HORRIBLE!....avoid her if you can, if you can't, then just keep on Praying!"
2617,"Seemed like a nice enough person, but wasn't very helpful as an accounting prof. Her lectures slides come from a disc in the textbook, so going to class was kind of a waste. Doing the problems is the only way to really learn the material. Tests are pretty difficult, especially the multiple choice."
1330,very easy class. professor rahhal is a great professor. go to class and you'll will easily get an A
690,"She is the coolest and funniest prof. at MSU whoohoo, she is so awesome....."

1897,"Pretty good class. It was easy, went by fast... and even though I missed classes I still did very well. She's very enthusiastic and makes everything enjoyable. First day of class was fun.. she tripped in front of everyone.. but it even put a smile on her face. Take this class!"
4368,He might be hard for a freshman or sophmore but i had him as a senior and you begin to appreciate brillant teachers. He is very good and knowledgeable. You might just need more maturity before you take him.
2706,Worse prof ever. Very mean and condescending. Love physiology but he totally ruined it for me!
1941,"One of the easiest gen eds, fully recommend"
4194,!!!DONT DONT BUY THE BOOK DO NOT BUY THE BOOK!!! I SWEAR YOU WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM IT I READ ALL THE SLIDES AND GOT AN &quot;A&quot; NO 'BS' THE BOOK IS COMPLETELY POINTLESS I DONT WANT PEOPLE TO SPEND $120 AND GET ONLY $52 AT END OF SEMESTER AND FIND OUT YOU PASSED WITH OUT IT!!!!
1634,"If you aren't a math person, you may struggle with him. He tends to repeat the same concepts over and over, but tends to jump to other topics partway through. I personally just found his style of teaching the material very boring, but also very scatterbrained. He tends to try to branch out to other concepts that aren't relevant. No accent though :)"

2715,"Sure I've never heard someone speak so monotonously, but I don't go to lecture to be entertained, I go to be taught facts.  His clear and organized lecture notes were amazing (esp compared to some sections that came later in the course), and Neuro101 might've been weird on its own, but as a complement to his lectures, it was pretty useful, actually"
3992,"Barely learned anything, spent more time troubleshooting his own examples than lecturing. 1 Phrase to summarize this class - Wasted potential"
416,You could tell he is very into biology and has a passion for it.  Very great and knowledgeable professor.  I would recommend him!
3611,"As a teacher she is nice and there is little work. But you have pop quizzes which you'll know about if you check your e-amil every night. Worst part, the tests are HARD!!!!"
4323,"I am surprised with all the negative comments towards professor Dennis. If you attend the classes and read the textbook, you will do excellent on the exams. Yes, he definitely rambles on at some points, but usually it is relevant to helping you understand the lesson. I recommend Dennis for those taking SOCI for a Gen Ed and just want an A."
227,"He is very interesting to listen to if you can avoid sitting near  other students that talk or text the entire time. His tests are tricky, unless you actually put in the time and effort required for a 5 credit hour class. I wish I was taking him for homeostasis."
2718,pretty good prof
2656,"Some people might have liked her sarcasm but I didn't. Lectures tend to be a waste of time, although occasionally solving problems in the second hour was helpful."
1288,"She is a nice funny lady class is mad easy, but tests suck don't listen to any of these other reviews I don't understand why she makes them so hard and uses stuff from the readings and complicated things... In the end u just end up hating her and pych in general"
4300,"This class might as well had been taught online, since the lectures were so useless that people would only show up on quiz and test days. Whenever I showed up, I would either work on stuff for other classes or just be on my phone. Just use the textbook and study guides he posts and you should do fine."
1237,"If you show up to class, do the online assignments, and read the required texts, this class is an easy A.  Professor Rahhal also offers extra credit which can help boost your grade. Tammy drops the lowest exam grade, two of the online assignments, and one of the in class pop quizzes."
2834,I took STA255 in Winter 2001.  This prof basically didn't use the textbook at all (making the course even harder) and seemed to run the course entirely for Stat/Math majors - difficult to get along with for sure.
2577,"She is such a bad teacher. She cannot teach/explain. Does absolutely nothing aside from coming to class (and often late). Tests are hard, lectures useless. Terrible prof at ut."
4294,This class is super easy and textbook based. I loved listening to his lectures because they were genuinely interesting most of the time and he's such a sweet funny man. 
665,He is a great teacher and he is sexy! He is passionate about English. Some of his students complain but he is NOT hard at all. The students who complain just don't want to do the work in college.
3050,"By far, the worst professor that I have had at Stanford. I am no longer interested in chemistry at all as a profession."
3209,Worst teacher I have ever taken at mason. Includes material she said she won't. On every exam I got 95% of the questions right but averaged a B. Why?She made 30% of the entire grade(weight) from 2 pages out of 100+ assigned for a test with the majority coming from a paragraph or an example- and she gives indication it wont be on exam to begin with

3978,"Prof. Bauman is awesome! If you haven't taken her class yet, do!  She makes Art History fun and exciting."
3524,"She is the best bio teacher, yes lectures are boring and it is hard to stay wake. However, as long as you understand the power points and memorize everything, you will be fine. However, it is not an easy A class."
3212,"She's really not that bad at all. She tells you exactly what will be on the test which is usually from the book and connect. Accounting isn't an easy subject. Go to class, pay attention, and study. Also if you do poorly on all 3 exams, but well on the final she'll make the final worth a lot! I want to take her again honestly."
2167,"Overall not bad. The lectures were LARGELY based on the textbooks, and at times it was tediously repetitive. Exams were almost identical to previous years exams, and tested strictly from material in the text with a few questions based on the material from the lectures thrown in. Easy mark for a social science credit."
19,"She is a very controversial teacher, I had her as a teacher and as a advisor. She is someone not to cross, be warned. She teaches fairly and unbiased for the most part. Her class work is decent and is useful to the course material. She uses different types of hw assignments too which is nice. I would say to take with caution. She liked me."
183,"Dr. Molumby goes off on tangents during his lectures, but at the end of them he does prove a point about the lecture material. Bear with him, because what he says could end up on the tests! And definitely focus on his Powerpoints and past tests to do well on the exams. You don't really need the book."
1588,"his class was very boring, there was hardly class participation, and he took questions only before tests."
3700,"All you need to do is read the assigned pages, which there are not very many of, and you will get an A. The lab is annoying but lecture is easy."
3826,Most boring class on earth.  You just sit and drool you are so bored. She reads DIRECTlY off her notes (that you can get online) and thats it.  Read the book and read the notes and you will be fine. Bring a magazine or something to class.
486,"Professor Capelotti conducts an extremely intriquing class each and every time.  I personally like his taste in style, due to its natural characteristics!  He is a beyond accomplished man with several published books to his name.  If you allow him to, he will broaden your horizens and educate you about a variety of topics. Take this teacher!"
3454,"Tests are pretty hard, but shes a great teacher, if you do all the homework and go to class you'll do fine."
2948,"gives confusing tests...is a nice prof but way too boring in my opinion. Tepperman says SOC101 is a bird course, yet its soo hard! i like the topics discussed in class though"
1255,"I loved coming to this class because it felt like stand up comedy especially compared to other lectures. You have to do the Hock readings for the ""pop quizzes"" (very easy) but I never read the other textbook, completely forgot to study for one exam, and easily got an A in the class and completely skipped the last unit of the course. Drops grades."
2011,"Awesome teacher! Probably the best/easiest class I've taken. She's hilarious and does activities to help understand concepts. All homework is extra credit, tests aren't too hard if you at least review, and she gives you all the notes so I never went to class and got a 92."
266,Very easy B not so much A.
63,best teacher ever thanks !!!
1965,Easy GenEd. Puts all powerpoints online and tests at multiple choise based on ppts. Very funny and uses good visual aids. Look over old tests. Keep track of homework. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT. EC points get added to test grade! Final optional and open book online! Won't have to work too hard to get an A but will have to study A LITTLE. pyramid exams.
2547,pretty good prof
2148,I didnt really like him. Knew his stuff but made the subject really boring. Arrogant and strict. dude needs to chill out.
2333,great
3644,The best biology teacher I have had so far. She is VERY animated which keeps your attention. Her slides a directly from the book. Overall the class was FUN!!! I wish all bio teacher would be enthused in what they teach as she.
3368,This class is pretty much self taught. Read over the chapters again and again and hope that you'll do OKAY on the tests. Her tests are much harder than she makes them seem. Goes over material so fast that it makes you not wanna go at all... Gives really good curves...but GOOD LUCK YOU'LL NEED IT!!
1543,I'm awful at math and I got nearly 100 in this class.  You don't even need to go to class to get an A.
2758,By far the worst professor I have ever had
3333,"Stay away from this professor.  She is unclear and she has favorites in the class.  Do not take this class with Hylton unless you really have to. If you do, be prepared to work extremely hard and to teach yourself."
103,the best i've ever seen
3762,"New to teaching and can't answer a lot of your questions outside of her powerpoints, but she is very nice and teaches what will be on the tests. She does iclicker questions to make sure you are attending class. I never opened the book."
508,he is very interesting and knows soooo much - i learned a lot and stayed interested every class.
4037,"Online. Seems like he is a strict enforcer of the rules, but wouldn't you expect that from an information security professor? Homework isn't too hard if you follow the directions. Also, he has a really cool accent. He's not as bad as everyone makes him out to be."
4337,"one of the nicest professor ever. i see him in ciao hall alot hahaha. He talks about things on and on in his lecture but trust me he's one of those good funny professor. He gives you a studyguide before each exam, so u really dont have to attend lectures just read book and get the studyguide. ....he talks about interesting things in his lectures"
1047,Professor Phyllis was great! Although I didn't have any prior knowledge or interest in biology his lectures were understandable. The review sessions that he does is also really helpful. He answers questions for as long as you want. I think if you have an interest in bio he would be an awesome professor to have.
865,very easy class. No real homework. Allows you to use a notecard on the exam. Can be funny at times
908,"I guess people would say she is easy and she is but she is all over the place when it comes to lecturing. She is a good person but .... I don't know.  Show up to class though, because she might give extra credit."
2727,Bad. Just Bad.
2123,"Egotistical, dull as nails lecturer. If you want to do well, take this class. If you want to learn something you didn't already know, there are much better options out there."
358,"I love this Prof. He makes lecture interesting and while his exams are hard, he tells you how to get an A and if you listen it's easy. I wish I wasn't graduating, otherwise I'd take another class with him."
3359,"My first B+; no more 4.0. Took the summer session at night. She says they'll never offer this class like that again. I did well on the projects, but bombed the tests. They were the kind of tests where you walk out feeling good, and then are surprised with a low score. She did concede to SOME contested questions. No curve. Useful re: info about CPA."
299,Awesome Teacher!! Very interesting professor! He knows exactly what he is talking about and can keep your interest in class
1003,"Randy is a good man but can be a very challenging confusing professor. If you don't have AP Bio background, you have to put in work for this class. This class is not based on memorization, its all about applications. All his quizzes and tests are true/false. The wording can be very tricky, he likes to combine many things. Read carefully & work hard"
3667,She is a very nice prof and is willing to help students if they need it BUT personally I think that she moves around too much and changes her voice so much that you forget to listen to what she is saying and concentrate on how she moves. Other than that Cell Bio is not an easy class so regardless of the prof. you need to study to do well.
3712,Very nice women. There's 3 tests and if you have to miss one then you can take the cumulative section on the Final and it'll make up for that. There's top-hat questions some classes but you could do those from bed during class if you really wanted. The lab is annoying but easy with on a little bit of homework every week and one formal lab report.
2863,totally memorizing........
761,"This was oddly the easiest class of my life. I actually never went (and never took Calc in highschool). Show up the week before an exam and you are set when he reviews everything. His exams are not hard, you just need to know what formulas to apply. I'm still confused why people say his class is difficult."
1299,Best professor I have ever had! The class is so entertaining you I learned so much from it. Do the readings..you can even do the modules right before the exam but read the readings in 40 studies! you will be quizzed on some. Exams can be tricky you just need to know examples of the terms in that unit. otherwise i highly recommend this course!!
2721,Horrible. Monotone lecturing style makes everyone sleepy. Rude when I talk to him after class. Not friendly.

3623,yea great professor if you like memorizing 250+ slides per test. she is ridiculous in her questions. feel like she tries to trick us. has multiple choice tests but does choice E as A&C thing which is annoying. also negates all the questions too. gives out &quot;study guides&quot; that are 8 pages long that aren't helpful at all.
1537,Sucks!!
2436,"Good prof, tho test was kinda hard."
3244,"Worst professor I've ever had at GMU. She went over final and told us what was NOT on the final, and still gave it. Did not answer my question during final and was very rude. Exams are tricky and hard. 70 questions on final and lots of calculations. Study everything. Don't listen to her on what she said. If you can avoid, don't take her period."
108,I went into CS106A thinking I just needed to fulfill a requirement.  I left and got a CS minor.  Very engaging.  Very user friendly introduction to CS.  True quote from a classmate: &quot;I'm so fuzzy I shed.  I love this class.  I can't believe I love this class.&quot;

1164,randy phillis is an amazing teacher.  he likes teaching and you can tell.  eager to help students learn
58,"This man is great, I know only one man that can teach so well."
76,I discovered this class on itunesU and got hooked.  He has a very engaging style and is interesting to listen to.  I wish my university had people like this!
3574,"She doesn't make the class very interesting, but even someone who doesn't like Biology can pass her class.  You don't need to attend class.  She does quizzes the week before an exam (on Tuesday), so study some for those.  Do the study guide she provides because that has everything that's on the test."
368,"Best biology teacher ever.  Makes the material relevant and interesting.  Know the material well...he expects you to know, &quot;what it is in addition to what is isn't&quot;.  If you dont come to lectures then you're screwed...Still, best teacher I've had in all my years of college."
2658,One word--&gt;TERRIBLE!....AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
785,"Can't understand a thing he says. Thank goodness i took calculus in high school cause if i didn't i would be so lost. too bad he is the only teacher who teaches 128, which i am forced to take next semester."
1321,"She makes lectures interesting. The tests aren't too hard, and she seems like a genuinely nice person."

1670,I only went to class for the first two weeks of the semester and still got an A. Just do the homework and go to the review sessions before tests. Don't bother buying the book because the Wiley access code you need for the homework comes with an ebook.
2750,"Tests are unbelievably difficult, but lectures are organized (though boring)."
3428,"I found this class to be difficult but not impossible. The key is to read the book, do the homework, and use the study guide. Its entirely possible to do well if you study."
3888,"Professor Bauman is a passionate, engaging and challenging prof. She will make you want to learn ,and want to be in her class despite your intimal interest. She is very fair, if you do your best, she will grade you accordingly. I have had her for three classes and she has been fantastic in all of them. Take Bauman, you will love her."
1157,Awsum teacher!! hes so funny and helpful! his tests are all multiple choice!
4095,bad college experience !!
2835,Worst professor! Rude and impolite!
910,One of the best teachers I've had at UWG. She's awesome!!
124,"I listed his use of a textbook high because he relies almost entirely on his online notes (which are free and very descriptive) so you don't have to buy an expensive book with a bunch of garbage in it.  He's a great instructor and while a bit eccentric, he's knowledgeable, helpful, and cares about teaching.  Highly recommended!"
3931,"3 tests none are cumulative(even the final). 2 papers: 1 based on reading, other based on a trip to Art Museum in D.C.. Bottomline: Attendance is mandatory, class is fast-paced(hard to keep up with), tests are hard and the papers are time consuming, she's perky and nice but at the end of the day she's not worth taking unless you absolutely have too"
2677,"Nice prof, well organized class.  tests a little hard but fair marking."
3423,"She has to be the worst teacher at Mason, recommend taking the class at the Prince William class where she does not teach.  I have to do this since I failed her the first time."
2699,"Horrible. (I am not one of the people who did bad in his class). 1) Very unfamiliar + very specific terminology. 2) Chooses to focus on the less necessary aspects of neurophysiology (which excites him), but not the general/intro stuff. 3)unenthusiastic 4)cynical 5)home-made lecture slides (with missing nuclei, axons, etc.).. Mostly SELF-Studying."
3008,"One of the best professors of U of T and also the great personality. He really do his best to help students. Very kind and good person. If you study hard you always can get you final &gt;80, if not ??? you will be behind."
442,Prof C is a riot in class. He has the best personality on campus you'll be laughing often. Read the textbook and take notes and you'll be fine.
1869,"She's very energetic, so avoid getting her in the morning. She's helpful though, and explains herself well. Good class overall."
4261,"Make sure you go to class because alot of what she discusses in class will be on the exams. Exams are ok.. some are pretty hard, make sure you go to class!"
2697,One of the worst and least helpful profs at ut. Monotone and boring lectures...cannot answer questions since he can't understand them.
1103,"I struggled the whole semester, went to every review session, got tutored  and still did horrible on the tests. What he teaches isn't in the book, he just throws a diagram at us and expects us to understand it then asks questions...and when I emailed him asking him what else to do to do better in the class he didnt even respond!"
1392,Tammy is such a great teacher. This material would be much more difficult without her personal anacedotes. She makes coming to class worth while and enjoyable. Take it since its an interesting gpa booster.
324,attendance not mandatory but you receieve points for going to class
2387,"Explains concepts very well, just not enough use of examples in class.  First year class, so midterm comes as a shock..very hard!...at first!"
1456,I strongly recommend avoiding taking a class with this professor. Exams are very long and difficult (hand written by him). Had a 3 and a half hour midterm on a Sunday. Notes in class are an absolute mess. Tough to get notes because he stands in front of what he is writing.
1188,a really cool guy.
4052,"Hard Class for a level 200. If your trying to get by in college don't take him, if your trying to be good at Information Security, Then attending his class is almost mandatory. He emphasizes things needed for the real world such as clear and concise writing and attention to detail. Yes, maybe a little obsessive but is necessary for the profession."
2425,Very engaging lecturer
1006,Randy is hilarious and a really nice guy. He expects you to know basic biology and builds on that in his Bio 151 class. I couldnt imagine taking this class if I hadnt taken AP Bio in high school. The class isnt easy but exams are only worth half of your grade and there are plenty of opportunities for extra help. Challenging but rewarding class. 
3706,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. DO NOT. If you need a credit for a lab science, choose any other one but this one. It is way too much work for a 100 level class, and it is a huge lecture and she sucks at it."
2380,Like this guy
3082,"Studied topology in concepts, walked out feeling ten times as intelligent, 1110 would take again."
4027,"This guy sucks, I'm in the networking industry and this guy is completely disconnected from how security should be taught to someone going into the workplace. He is rude, unresponsive to emails, gives you useless discussion board and homework assignments. Finally, the tests come content found within 500+ slides and are extremely difficult/useless."
6,"She's really nice and helpful, but is extremely challenging. It's not overwhelming, but she's still a hard grader. You really need to keep up everyday with the readings to do well on pop quizzes."
932,"Prof Christopher is the funniest and most personable instructor I have ever had.  She cares for her students and is passionate about what she teaches.  I heard good things about her prior to her class, but never imagined that she was even more awesome that what people said.  Take her!!!!"
439,"He's an incredibly intelligent person. If you need help or have a question he will go out of his way to do anything he can to help you. To pass his class all you have to do is show up, participate, improve, and ask questions and make inquizzitive comments in your papers!"
1967,"This class is really easy, one homework per week which takes about 10 minutes to do. It really isn't necessary to attend class because she just goes through a powerpoint that is posted online. She allows 2 attempts on the tests, the second being open note. Optional final exam and optional term paper, neither of which can hurt your grade."
1554,"Worst teacher ever! seriously.. doesn't know how to teach, kinda mean, and he only goes &quot;AHHH&quot; in class and he makes a lot of mistakes when it comes to calculations. Basically if you take his class is like you are teaching math yourself, if you are not that good at math do NOT take his course."
4055,Avoid at all costs...change your major if you have to!
2338,"Efficient, well run lectures. Can be repetitive. Overall, easy and interesting!"
1876,This class really isn;t that hard and you don;t have to even go to it because you buy the notes at the Textbook Annex with your book. The class is simple as long as you study a little for the test and do all the online quizes and discussions. The only problem is if you have her in the morning get ready for a peppy lady who won;t let you sleep.
1765,I hate Calc... and prof cook makes it even more confusing..talks like you know what he s talking about
3011,"He is one of the best professors I have had.and besides being a great prof, I must say he is a great Person too ! he was amazing !"
1183,great teacher. made intro biology something that was actually fun to go to everyday
4385,His lectures are a waist of time. Just read the book and you'll do good on exams.  His class was pretty easy.
194,"Only way you prepare for his exam is to go over many old ones. Soft spoken so sit in the front! Come to lecture with ur ppt slides and listen carefully. iCliker & Participation pts (discus)!  Labs were rofl easy! Do well on lab reports, presentations, problem sets, and EXAMs! Better than Bio101 w Malchow. Every little pt. counts! You got this! "
2274,"i liked the prof, but the material covered was a bit basic/self-evident."
2101,"Professor Brym made me want to specialize in Sociology. I loved his lectures. I loved talking to him in person. He is great. The people in my class who didn't like him were slackers looking for an easy mark. If you want to actually learn, you should take his class."
2422,"A very energetic prof. His midterms were hard, but the finals are easy."
3441,Very helpful. Always wanted to answer questions. Very hard tests!
1200,"One of the best professors on campus. Has a roundabout way of teaching, but in the end he gets his pint across... with a few jokes too. Not out to get you at all. Wants you to learn and understand."
1487,"no one rocks a ponytail better than this guy, apparently no one told him that was cool back...oh wait never...writes literally every word he says down on a projector completely unneccessary, waste of time going to the class, his exams sometimes do not make any sense at all"
2574,"dont even bother going to class. lectures consist of repeating textbook material for hours. extremely monotonous and boring. that being said, tests are not that easy but not insanely hard. take good textbook notes and study, you should be good."
222,EXTREMLY NICE PERSON
4256,"Lecture is boring, lab is not so bad. Show up to lab, because its easy points.  Tests are not too difficult, but requires some studying.  She is a nice person, gets angry when you come late."
573,No Comments
3735,"Dr. Largen is a nice person but she is super boring! She, also, talks about one subject for a super long time which is so annoying. After most things she says, ""oh this won't be on the test."" THEN WHY THE HELL DID YOU JUST SPEND 30 MINUTES TALKING ABOUT IT. She takes fever etimes get to her point, but she's nice (: oh & lots of extra credit"
1793,"Pretty boring class, her jokes are very bad and she never stops making them. Attendance is not totally mandatory but it definitely helps. There are a bunch of extra credit opportunities. Not too bad of a class if you do not mind horrible jokes and obnoxiousness."
418,ewwwww!!!! he is so not hot!!!! class is okay...
2575,Everything she teaches is in the book; there is no point in to going to class
1104,Harsh humor
257,"Assignments/Discussion/Lab/ Icliker points are easy to earn, so don't miss them. Labs are very simple, not quite interesting. For the exams, studying the slides+ old exams can get you a B easily. Understand the materials will help u earn an A. I didn't attend the lectures often, only studied the night before the exam and earned an A."
295,"Great teacher. He accounts for his difficult tests by dropping the lowest, which is helpful if you mess up on one. His questions on exams just require you to remember his annectodes, which are actually entertaining, and to also use common sense. STUDY PAST EXAMS. Also extremely helpful in office hours."
1429,"Great teacher! Shes really cool, gives great notes, involves the class and shows how psychology affects your life. Great teacher!!!!"
4280,I took Dr. Dennis over the summer for Social 308 - race and ethnicity.  He was so nice and knowledgeable and has a great voice to listen to during lecture.  I really enjoyed his class and would highly recommend him for anyone looking to learn about race and ethnicity.
3541,Dr.Fondufe is not a hard professor. You actually do have to put. In a great deal of effort in this. Class as with any other class but tests are right off the PowerPoints. Don't read the book. One exam can get dropped which really can save you. Good teacher. Would take her.
1344,Best class ever!
3239,"Accounting is hard, and Hylton is pretty tough. I studied religiously from the book and connect homework and did every practice problem from the book and internet. This got me an A. Hylton's teaching style is confusing, and attending recitation and studying are necessary for success. Bring the right calculator to tests or she won't let you use one."
3620,"great teacher.gives out a lot of notes so it actually makes sense.study guides are helpful.class can get a little boring but paying attention makes it a lot easier when you're studying.she doesn't try to trick you.She is great at explaining things, reading the book also helps for more clarity. If you are a decent student and try you will like her."
712,one of the best professors i have ever had. should definitely take this course!!!
1641,"Cooks an awesome guy, but now he's so old he does not care at all.  Completely checked out and his teaching style shows.  I learned more about the 60s than I did anything about math.  If you have to take him to go another professors lectures or teach yourself online.  Avoid if possible"
3698,Boy do I love spending $80 on a lab notebook that she wrote :)
1323,Great prof.  Great lectures that will keep you entertained. Your grade is a game of pts.  HW and quizzes are easy. Exams are so-so.  Try to do extra credit experiements during the semester.  There easy and bumped me up to an A-.
4025,"Professor Lyons is a flawed instructor and has a very abrasive personality. I might be able to tolerate how much of a hard-ass he is, if it weren't for the fact he himself is a procrastinator and error prone. He has the potential to be a great professor but he is either unable or unwilling to improve  himself for the sake of his students."
449,"I absolutely hate this class. This idiot of a professor gives the worst tests ever. He gives the kind in which most of the questions, he would cherry pick information that was mentioned in passing, like an afterthought, and not actually important to the course. Ugh so bad. No one should ever have to put up with this."
1697,"First, Professor Cook is a really a nice guy and he tries his best to teach to 300 people.  Everything about this class will frustrate you.  OWLs are hard and sometimes not relevant to lecture, sometimes not relevant to the book.  Class will not help you prepare for exams very well so unless you're already great at calculus, you will not do well."
4220,"She's a ****. However, her lecture isnt that bad, she's very professional and tries to make class interesting. Lab and lecture are so similar that you probably don't have to goto both in a week unless you want reinforcement. The 10pg paper sucks, but you can revise it. The book is used very little, but you need it to study for exams."
958,Professor Schurter teaches a few different classes in Isenberg and I would definitely recommend trying to enroll in one before your time here at UMass is up. Fantastic professor and truly cares about his students.
1270,Easily my favorite professor! Her lectures are so interesting and she makes them fun for a 9am class. I would love to take this class again. She is very enthusiastic about what she teaches. Easily the best grading system I've ever had too. The final is basically optional and she drops 1 exam. Gives plenty of extra credit. Definitely take her class!
654,"He basically taught as if the students were of the elementary school skill level. Marked points off on ANY essay that did not start a body paragraph with firstly, secondly, thirdly, etc. Enumeration in such a way is hardly a necessary compnent when the flow can be controlled in many other ways."
2127,"Brym was one of my favorite prof. in my first year. His lectures were well organized and well presented. If you do your readings and attend lectures (take a look at past tests too!), you can get an A like i did :)"
4198,"This class is super easy. Just attend the labs, view the online lectures, and scan through the book. The material is very easy, there is a ton of extra credit. You should start on the paper a week before it is due for an A. EASY! Highly recomended"
2135,He made this class awful. He uses old data and his opinions are questionable. Don't talk in class. He incited an all out riot when he refused to continue teaching because a student was talking.
2228,Worst Professor ever....DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!  If you like talking in class forget about it because he will stop lecturing and pick you out of a crowd of 1500 students and yell at you for talking...he is the worst...so boring

1444,Rudvalis is the man.
1675,"NICEST TEACHER. EVER. He's a great guy. Go to his office hours. The class is terribly confusing and hard, but if you talk to him about your grade he can be reassuring.  Lectures are confusing but he will meet with you personally any time of day to talk about stuff in lecture or your grade."
3334,"She is the most anal strcit prof ever. She dont want people to go to the bathroom, if you come in late you get a speech, and she will end class early if people dont seem like they are into the class. BUT I learned alot in this class I understood the materials and she was very clear. Not an easy person to get alone with but a good prof."
2894,"OK class, he tends to ramble a lot. Terrible tests that do not focus on relevant information but rather very specific details. A lot of reading."
1413,The clearest teacher I've had and also the easiest to learn from because she gives great examples.  In order to do well on tests you have to study a lot tho.  But she drops the lowest test grade out of 4.  She creates a very relaxing environment.
2770,even though neurophysiology is crazy hard!! he's really good.
2780,"I hated him when I took his course. But now when I turned to Year 3, I found many stuff he taught in second year actually covers many aspects of  the third year probability courses. In other words, if you ace in his course, you will find pretty easy to study the consequent courses. "

1242,"Tamara's lectures are really interesting and she is a nice woman. If you show up to class, it's hard not to get an A."
2213,"Amazing prof. One of the best profs at U of T. His website is amazing. He gives sample questions. The course is not easy, really have to keep up with the readings and UNDERSTAND the stuff. But this prof is one of the better profs I've had at U of T"
3293,Teaches nothing from the book. makes you buy the book and online hw which is extra 50 dollars. Tests get progressive hard. Was not an easy class. I have to retake this class now TAKE PAUL HARLEY
1268,"This is hands down the best professor I have ever had at UMass Amherst. I do not think there will be a better professor. If you need this gen-ed, take it. If you need to fill your schedule up, take it. This was such an amazing class with several opportunities to do well. I got an A with a breeze with no Psychology background knowledge. "
102,very good
2254,"lectured (boringly) straight out of his text book and so most of the material could be learned by reading the text book. very egotistical, and presented tests which seemed to be more about trick questions, than actual test of knowledge"
1533,"Prof. Rudvalis is a disorganized, bad professor.  We didn't get through nearly enough material, he was constantly late to class, and had a screwy grading system.  I got an A in the class, but only because I taught myself.  To his credit, however, he is very helpful in office hours and knows his mathematics."
2281,2 words: boring and egotistical
2819,ok.. funny guy.  do past exam u will do fine.
2484,He was an excellent prof. Gave easy tests and always knew how to make you laugh. &quot;Ok...Excellent&quot;.
2564,Awesome Prof!
3250,"She comes off as mean. Accounting may not be my thing but her style doesn???t help. The stuff she lectures about, what's in the book & what is on the HW/quizzes, are different. She expected everyone to study, not practice, every day. The format of her quizzes is could be a bit simpler.  I would not recommend taking her."
2501,Charlie Browning&#63;  Wouldn't it be funny if he was named after Charlie Brown.  Hahaha!  Go Chemistry!!!
3801,Largen rambles a lot. Her lectures are boring and hard to follow (she explains lots of concepts when her exams are almost entirely definitions) and most of her material is not in the textbook which makes it difficult to study the questions on her study guides (which are about 13 pages long because she never cuts out material that she didn't cover)
2633,"I have no cue why she would give very simple and easy examples in the lecture and give EXTREMELY hard test that is almost impossible to complete in 1.5 hours.  Her questions so confusing and unclear in test, which is not fair.  If she expect to answer that kind of questions, at least show examples i"
1257,"It is okay. That's about it. I honestly wasn't as enamored with Rahhal as everyone else seems to be, so I'm probably the outlier. Her lectures are engaging, but I didn't love how we were graded. I don't love the point system. Exams were honestly a little more difficult than a 100 course has the right to be. Not a bad course, but nothing must take"
1961,"I love her!!! She is the best professor, she explains everything so well and is more than fair with grading. She truly wants you to learn above all else. Plus, this class was full of laughs, definitely take it! I can't say enough about how awesome this class was, I would take another class with Prof Goodenough in a heartbeat!"
1064,Amazing professor.  His lectures consist of multiple iclicker questions.  The only prob is you have to listen carefully 2 what he is saying when he goes over the questio because he sometimes doesn't give u the answer He wants you 2 figure it out on your own. go to discussions. si sessions mos def people think its hard because they suck at studying.
4139,"Prof Lyons gives hw's that are way too long! He gives a project which is the longest project ive ever had to do seriously. he makes the class way harder than it needs to be , most people also find him very rude"
818,Calc 2 is not an easy subject therefore it is important to look for extra help. you cannot expect to do well by simply showing up to class and taking notes. The math help center is good for reinforcement and Prof Cook is usually available whenever you would like to schedule an appointment.
4276,Dennis is honestly a really sweet professor. The only grades for the class are 3 tests and 3 quizzes. If you honestly just read the book and base your studying on his study guides you can pull a B.
3023,Boring and disorganized.  His notes and lack of textbook suck.  He has an arrogant way about him.  He is funny though.  The course has potential but would need a lot of reorganization to be good.
816,class is hard but calc 2 is hard. he goes on tangents in class irrelevant to anything. buy the book
3938,Take Bauman only if you are going to major in art hist.She clearly knows too much to be teaching a gen ed class. She expects too much from her students.Her exams are extremely hard.The study guides that she gives help a little.She's a cool person but you would have to study your &quot;ass off&quot; for atleast a  -B.

3487,She is the most enthusiastic bio lecturer I have every had! She makes me feel bad for occasionally skipping class lol. If you study the very long PowerPoint and study guides you should be able to get an A or B.
3783,Best Professor I've had so far! She is so friendly and always willing to help any student (she'll remember you too). As long as you take notes during the lecture + DO the study guides= guaranteed A. Take her class if you can! By far my favorite class this semester!
864,"much better calc teacher than rudvalis (127). Cook is nice, goes over the material for a while. Tests are pretty easy, lets you use a &quot;note card&quot;  (although i actually used a sheet of paper folded in half, both sides + inside). Good calc prof!"
4223,"One of the best professors and believe me have had only 2 till now. Class was great, the prof was great, teaching was great! She was good in every aspect. She is tough grader agreed but then she also puts in as much effort in her teaching. So it is quite natural that she expects that much. Highly recommend MBA 713 with her. You will be glad!"
2452,"Yes, the test was a bit challenging..but he is a beautiful, beautiful man so I forgive him :D"
554,Great Prof.  Pretty cute
1159,GREAT
1261,"Tammy is a great professor! She makes lectures very interesting with her stories and videos. Sometimes the exams can be a little tricky, but as long as you go to class and do the homework you'll be fine"
1609,"pretty easy class, pretty weird guy"
1662,"Means well, but lecture does not follow the book.  He teaches Math 128 as if it was Math 132.  You can read and understand the book and walk out of lecture scratching you head.  Avoid if at all possible."
4147,"The tests he gives are very comprehensive, The project also took me 20+ hours to do. I learned a lot though."
4335,"This professor is one of the nicest, sweetest and funniest professors you'll ever have.  His classes are not incredibly interesting(sometimes he just rambles on and on)but I think it's still very much worth it to take his class.  He's an easy and fair grader.  I took his class in the summer and it was very laid back."
748,He's nice and funny but he's not great. He's better off teaching calc theory than basic calc. There are only 4 total grades - 3 exams and homework. You can redo homework a million times but Wiley is annoying. TAs were a lot more helpful. Go to reviews and SIs. He does not respond to email.
3312,"very strict, you will be called every classes to answer questions, but it forces you to study hard. accounting is the class I hate the most, but fortunally her teaching helped me to pass the class, you will thank her in the end. also, summer class is easier, try to take in summer."
866,"His tests are more clear than Math 127 tests, kind of a funny teacher, but makes me sleepy."
752,"I can see where people are coming from when they negatively rate this professor, but I had no issues with the class. Cook teaches by example and his practice exams are very similar to real exams. The only annoying thing is that he doesn't use technology so don't try e-mailing him.  Overall, acing this class should not be an issue if taken seriously"
3540,"GOOD:Good explainer. Makes class interesting. Simplifies concepts.   BAD: Tricky test (easy concepts). Can lecture fast. Focuses lecture on pictures (can't take notes), not worded slides."
2194,Very pompous and cocky.
3399,"She is not sensitive at all.  Shes very tough and can come off as mean and intimidating.  The class is hard and she goes really fast.  She calls people out and embarrasses people in front of everyone.  Do all your work, study hard, and be prepared to be put on the spot...good luck!"
1426,"speaks well, teaches a class of 500 people as if she's teaching 25 people. gives fair amounts of work, gives more extra credits, fun, and fair on tests! best professor i've ever had in umass so far!"
729,"If you think calculus is hard as is and you feel like torturing yourself, then Professor Cook is for you. He refuses to use any type of technology to make understanding better for the student. No iclickers and attendance was not mandatory. He never explains things in a general form and just goes over random problems right in the beginning."
2117,"He's brilliant, kind, and intelligent. He made me fall in love with Sociology and I'm always thankful to him."
1813,The homework is easy but I would have rather have had quizzes in between exams in order to test my assessment more frequently and balance out my grade. Her tests seemed to ask tricky questions and some were useless in that they had asked the names of certain people which not as important as understanding concepts.
2910,Amazing lecturer! Really enjoyed everyone of the classes and the tests were very fair. He made it clear that the tests were mainly from the books so I don't why people are complaining. And yes the books are written by him but he is a researcher. He is presenting his research and ideas to us and I think he made that clear.
3109,"Nerdy, funny personality. Genuinely enjoys teaching. Hates when people skip or don't pay attention. He ran out of the room to chase a guy who tried to skip out after taking attendance. Good at explaining things, but he does proofs faster than you can think about them. Sometimes, he will expect you to know really obscure integration rules."
1110,I thought Randy was great. His classes were never boring and his tests were fair. Go to class and you should be fine.
3257,She is a good professor. She might expect a lot from you but we are accounting students we are supposed to be willing to work hard and learn the material. Midterm and Final were not bad. I would recommend going to her office hours to ask questions about the assignments. Anyone can get A study for exams and do all assignments.
346,really cool prof. one of the best at UIC
1718,"the guy is the math teacher on campus. good teacher and explains things thoroughly, but he is hard to track down for office hours.  the people who complain about his teaching are only the people that have problems with math and failed the course.  he makes it relatively eay to get a good grade if you ar willing to work for it (but not teach urself)"
3103,"Good Professor, usually keeps class interesting.  A little to many proofs."
4110,He is one of the most incompitant professors in GMU.  His interest is to play with ther assignments to assure failure of a proportion of his class.  He does so by creating convoluted exams and lectures.  He will give 45 questions to be solved using only 1 mins/ques.  This tests nothing.  Do not take any of his classes.  He is &quot;Lord Voldemort.&quot;!!!!!
578,Excellent notes and assignments on the web.  He really wants you to know your stuff.  Great prof.
4089,This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He NEVER replied to any of my emails and never even made an attempt at answering my questions. Graded material is extremely vague when returned and doesn't explain it if you ask. This class is hard to begin with but when you combine it with Lyons it becomes horiffic. I don't recommend him
3438,"I think her main problem is that she talks fast and rushes through the material SO quickly assuming everyone is with her. Her exams are difficult. She is ok, would be much better if she slowed down!"
1896,She made lots of jokes and made it seem more interesting for an into level course
3949,"Prof. Bauman is a wonderful person and a fun teacher! She has so much energy, which kept me engaged through her entire lectures, and she has a great sense of humor. She truly seems to care about all of her students, and she is very compassionate when there is a problem. My only complaint is that she sometimes was a little harsh in her grading."
2949,I have never met a professor with fewer social graces in any class I have taken.  I hear all he has published for years is intro. textbooks.
178,"I'm not a biology major, but I've always been interested in Ecology & Evolution; this class was definitely enjoyable because of the professor. He is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Sit in front - not his fault the people in the back are loud and disrespectful during lecture. Would've had an A if I had done ALL my homework. HE'S FUNNY TOO. best"
3781,Very easy to work with; don't have to worry about purchasing a textbook but the lab manual is still pretty expensive; would have gotten an probably if I had kept up with required assignments a bit better
4006,"Professor Lyons is very strict on his rules and he will call you out if you don't follow them. After reading the reviews, i was prepared for the worst, but it turns out he's actually a GREAT professor. The course itself is VERY unorganized but he is a good teacher nonetheless. Make you sure take notes EVERY class and try not to miss any lectures."
3467,Super easy class. Just read her PowerPoint slides and do the study guides. The class is all lectured so it does get boring but the notes are online so you don't even have to go to class. Would definitely recommend.
1909,"great teacher, makes class interesting, tests are easy and there's tons of extra credit."
604,Everett expects you to persuasively argue your interpretation of literature.  He cares more about persuasiveness than originality. He would rather you reiterate the interpretation he teaches in class IF and only IF that is more persuasive and well-supported than your own interpretation. Some get offended due to their inability to be persuasive.
2155,"As a 2nd year engineer taking this as an elective, SOC 101 wasn't a big priority but it's a year course worth double weight for the GPA after semester 2 so I buckled down, did the readings on the weekend prior to the lecture and bam, 90+. Easy mark, interesting course, take it seriously and you won't regret it."
25,"Prof. Hora is definitely a hard professor, and made her intro class too difficult.  She grades too much on class participation. However, she gives ample opportunities for extra credit,truly understands the subject matter, and it is definitely possible to get an A."
658,I am surprised to see all the negative comments about him. I had him for two semesters (Comp 1&2) and I very much enjoyed his class. He always helped if I needed it. Will take him for his Brit. Lit. class.
2578,"extremely lazy, does no work. Also, very subjective. Picks favourites. Highly unfair grading system. The very worst professor ever had in my life. The worst."
2290,he's alright.  speaking to 1500 students ain't easy.
173,"Was enthusiastic going into BIOS101 since I heard good things about him. However, this man tends to go on a lot of rants and is hard to hear during lecture. Even worse, some exam questions will ask something random from a lecture or his poorly written slides. Rude and low-key bashes on the possibility of a god. Made me dislike ecology. Self taught"
3622,she is a great professor. teaches bio 213. Very energetic and moves her body while teaching.. haha. cool professor to take. i recommmend her. tests are 50 questions and she posts up powerpoints!!!
331,"so much material to learn but very interesting. Read every chapter & ask questions!!!! Also, Dr. Mulumby's lectures are far from boring- he's a great professor!"
342,"absolutely fantastic lecturer. if you read the text and do well in lab, you could get by w/o goin to lecture, but you would be doing yourself a disservice...plus, some of the test is from the lecture. difficult tests, but if you know your stuff they are fine. overall though, fabulous teacher."
2176,Great
1088,"He is very nice and funny. However his teaching methods confuse me, and although I understand that he wants us to learn the process, I felt that if he taught the mechanisms and definitions too it probably would have helped. He is pretty unclear on average."
479,"Prof Capelotti is a great man with a plethora of information useful and irrelevant to the course material. I took his anth 021 and 045, every class was different. He made it very exciting, and gives people the opportunity to discuss their opinion. Test are very fair."
727,"This Brother is an awesome teacher, ask him any question and you'll get the answer on the spot! A man of principles.  Easy to approach and good sense of humour. A fair-game player, meaning treats students equal. -Zman"
2939,"Course material is easy. However course load is high. Lectures are a waste of time,though he tries to make them interesting. Tests are multiple choice, moderate difficulty. Final Exam is cumulative. If you have to take SOC101 take Tepperman vs the other professor; He is easier. Overall interesting course, but definitely not a bird course"
976,"The coolest teacher I've ever met. He really cares about his students and is willing to help bascially everything. Since Jr. writing is mandatory, I would highly recommand take this class for the requirement. The best part is, he is really easy on grading."
1258,"Amazing teacher!!! Her lectures are very interesting and engaging. She's really funny and just down to earth. There's a lot of note-taking in class, but there are outlines that she puts up that makes it easy. Read the readings she assigns!!! Because she does do pop quizzes on them sometimes. Just keep up with her assignments and you'll be fine."
3710,"Dr. Largen means well however most of the lecture is taken up by her babbling off on tangents about irrelevant stories and then after she wastes the whole class on it, she tells you its not on the test. I did not learn much. The materials for the class are expensive and lab is a bunch of busy work. If you do the learning guides the tests are easy."
2042,She really wants her students to learn something from her classes.
2221,great
2784,STA257 will McD is quite manageable if you pay very careful attention to his notes do the problems that he assigns. It is good preparation for upper year stat courses.
3951,"Awesome teacher, never new art was a great thing until I took her class, very easy, lecture was actually nice to listen to just study your notes for exams. Strongly reccommend"
2364,"Good prof, lectures are interesting and can be funny, he definitely cares about the students. Tests are quite hard, but not completely unreasonable."
1455,"This is a very VERY easy class. If you want an easy A, take this class. Study from the practice tests he gives you and you will get an A"
1657,"Really is a kind old guy, who likes to tell stories that sometimes last half the class. Likes to ramble and stand at the board writing and writing like we know what he's doing. If you aren't good at math don't take this class if you don't have to. Homework will bring up your grade a little, and if you show a lot of effort he may help you along."
1468,This is a difficult prof. he's asking tough probability questions in a math 100 class....
3705,"This class is supposed to be an easy A, but it has been more work than it's worth. There are three tests in the semester which wouldn't have to be hard, BUT she has a lot of long questions where you have to figure out which statements are true (10+ statements). She gives random top hat ?'s & in-class activities. The lab is annoying. I hope for a B."
4044,The tests and quizzes aren't very hard as long as you get the definitions and the concepts/how it is implemented in real life. The homeworks are stupid and you don't really learn anything from them but make sure you do well on them because they are worth almost half of your grade.
1407,"it's a good thing i had her at 9 a.m. MWF cuz you actually WANT to go to the class, and then you're already up so you go the rest of you classes. she makes it very fun and you actually LEARN. readings are really not that bad. just do them, go to class, and that's really all you need. TAKE HER CLASS!"
2475,one of the best prof. u of t has...great personality with great knowledge...&quot;ok...right&quot;
4068,"This guy may intimidate you at first, but he's a good professor.  THE professor to take 223 with.  He does curve, but its not something you should rely on!  I got  B- for the class and I studied ALOT, and did great on the HW (40% of the final grade).  Good luck!"
3258,"Hylton is actually quite nice and helpful, you just have to get used to her personality. Ask questions if you're confused about something because she doesn't always explain things clearly the first time. The most important thing is to start the system project early and ask questions about it. Overall, not a bad class."
2216,excellent
67,Simply awesome teacher
4074,"He's a good teacher, but he doesn't takes things too seriously.  There is &quot;reading time&quot; after each test is given out, and he claims that he will report us to the honor committee if we pick up our pens during &quot;reading time&quot;.  Treats the class like kindergarten.  However, he does do a good job teaching, and if you do the homework, you should pass."
221,He was a decent professor. He teaches easy concepts through long stories and they appear on the tests. He is very helpful during office hours and after class.
3328,"READ the book, its really helpful. She's really not that bad and neither were her exams. I got an A and I never did the hwks. Just understand key concepts by READING the book, btw, MC questions at the back of the book ARE on the exams :)"
2691,No Comments
3282,"Pro. Hylton is a hard teacher. However, if you read the text book, go to classes, and do the online practices(don't forget to study the online problems), then you should be able to pass the class with a C or above."
3961,"I was definitely not interested in this class, but found myself actually WANTING to go to class.  She makes it so interesting.  Also, with the 3 papers, she really helps you out, you just have to ask.  She'll spend a whole class period going over what the papers should be like.  Go to class, take notes, and study a bit and you've got it made."
88,He is the best teacher i ever had..and feel lucky to attend his lectures.***** star Rating from my side.Long live M.Sahami
3673,Really loves bio and gets really into her lectures.  Tests are hard but come right from the notes so if you go to class and really study your notes you'll get an A.
2202,Brym knows his stuff but makes the tests challenging.  It's a great course and the book of articles that accompany the studies was VERY interesting.  I'll probably continue to make SOC at least a minor and take something of his in the future.
3363,"She is very rude to her students. Unfair with grading, if possible take it with baker."
1590,No Comments
2242,"How hard is it to just talk slower&#63; Lectures were organized but boring, basically an oral text book. For some reason he didn't like it when pple got up (to pee/leave) when he's talking. Guess he needed the view of a full auditorium for his ego."
3148,The most boring man ever to walk the earth.
3995,"Prof. Lyons knows his stuff. Lectures are of good quality. You will have to work hard to earn the grade you want, nothing is given to you. Very strict on grading for assignments. Fair grader on exams.   IT304 was not his class, he filled in for another professor so things were rough. I'm sure that in his own classes things would go smoother."
3932,"Ok guys, I agree with what everyone said... but honestly, this is not an 'easy A' class... trust me, if you just want an elective in which you do no work at all and get an A do not expect this to be your class. I BUSTED my butt off studying and got a B+.... but, if you want an interesting class and teacher, then go for it... you will like it."
2605,No Comments
2384,He's quite enthusiastic about the course content. Explains materials well enough. His midterm can be challenging (avg = high 50s) but doing all the assigned problem sets you should get an 85+.
397,I had him in the summer. He was a good teacher really into what he teaches.
3986,shes made a boring subject really interesting..this class is highly recommended..!!
2298,"reads his notes all class, ...EZ to sleep in class"
3220,HARD class. I'm no dumby and struggled in this class hardcore. This is essentially a brand new subject for everyone and you'd think they'd possibly make it a tad easier ??my only recommendation is to take a different prof. hylton's not helpful. if you have questions you have to ask in front of the entire lecture??
3599,"Lectures are alright, notes are online but I did not learn much during the class. The best method I found was skipping class reading each section and going over her notes after each of the respective sections. This is not a class you can get by with only slacking. Came out with an A but was one of the more challenging classes I have taken."
3184,"Real talk, DON'T take her. The class layout is pretty easy and her tests aren't too bad, if you study from connect hw+ quizzes but that final- that was a different breed of difficult. I came to class, did all my work and studied hard and I walked out most likely flunking, and this is coming from someone who has a 3.8 GPA. "
1096,Awful teacher.He made me hate Biology
2339,Website is amazing! Test questions can be confusing!
2328,appears to think the world revolves around him and his book
979,I will admit he definitely does care for his students but the way his exams and quizzes were designed made it a difficult intro course. Multiple true false with limited multiple choice.  He also has material appearing on the exams which may not be reviewed in class. His powerpoints don't a lot of info either. Be ready to listen and take notes.
283,"Ecology&Evolution. Interesting in class. Attend lecture tho, it is what exams are based on. Reading helps to understand more in-depth. Cool guy. Proponent for the LGBT community, but has a wife himself. Awesome dude - his main study experience are in bees/wasps."
1298,"Tammy is a wonderful professor. Make sure you study the textbook readings AND your notes before tests. She loves drawing from things not covered in class. Other than that, psych 100 is a very straightforward class. Do the readings (they're easy and almost always interesting), go to class, study a bit. You'll get an A."
898,She is so funny! She gives GREAT feedback and awesome lectures. She is really helpful in class. Her tests are super easy if you just show up and take notes.
3382,"She's a really mean, rude professor. She knows her material, but she is just so...unpersonable. She gets all worked up if someone, even if very quietly, gets up to go to the bathroom. She calls people out in class, which is intimidating. Overall, I wish I didn't have to take any more classes with her, but unfortunately she teaches upper levels too."
4312,"Aint gonna lie. I missed ALOT of classes and I still got an A. Just make sure you read the text book and you should be straight. Honestly, it's an easy gen ed you should be straight."
4232,"She has an attitude problem and should reevaluate her career in teaching management.  You would think that she would learn something from her own lectures, but obviously that's not the case.  I passed her class, but was shocked at what I saw and heard."
613,"This class is one of the best at CTC.  Prof. Everett has put a huge amount of work into this class and it shows.  If you want to learn more about British literature, history, and culture, take it!   If you do the work, you will love the class!  "
2937,i was excited for sociology..however i hated his class. Lectures are boring and dont reflect the material we are expected to know for the tests. Very challenging course.
4285,"He just talks for the entire lectures, no notes at all. I never went to class. As long as you READ THE CHAPTERS in the book and FILL OUT THE STUDY GUIDE, you're golden. The professor is a great guy, super knowledgeable and humorous. Had me generally laughing. Might've gone to class just for him if the class wasn't so early. Tests aren't too bad."
2146,yummy
423,Pompous pseudohipster who blathers on and on about how cool he is.
4072,"He is absolutely horrible. His homework assignments are excrutiatingly difficult, and far worse, they're utterly useless in the real world, just rote learning that he makes you do because he likes to feel like he is in control. Very harsh and difficult to talk to. I did like how loud he was though, VERY easy to hear what he was saying. Avoid !!"
1565,"He is very rude when answering questions and does not cover the material clearly.  He writes everything he says on the over head, which is good, however his hand writing is very difficult to read."
2973,"TAKE THIS CLASS, you don't have to go to lecture as long as you have the recordings but honestly would recommend an immunology and biology background!"
839,Cook makes this a really hard class. He refuses to actually teach the material by using examples and going over things step by step. According to him thats not his job. His job is to teach mathmatics not to hold your hand. He goes off topic a lot to complain about cell phones and calculators. If you can take any other teacher for calc I suggest it.
500,"Literally told a student to go to the National Archives in Washington to research my paper. I don't know what these crazy explorers have to do with American Studies. Personally biased. He needs to get off his sledge and step out into the real world, where students can't just get up and go to D.C."
2794,THEORETICALLY INTENSE BUT YOU HAVE TO REREAD HIS NOTES AND WRITE OUT THE PROOFS YOURSELF TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS.
1545,"Very bad, very rude, and very hard to understand."
549,"Tough class. She seems like a cool person, but as a teacher...I dunno. She's really tough."
557,Best prof I had.  Neat lectures and uses &quot;who wants to be a millionare&quot; clickers.  Says the marks are for participaation but it really makes you come to class.
1820,Easy class.  3 exams and an optional final.  SPARK quizzes are simple.  Pretty similar to her intro class.  Definitely take it for Psych credit.
2267,No Comments
218,"You will either love him or hate him. Molumby is an awesome Bio professor & my fav so far. Direct & honest and he knows his stuff. Nice & interesting labs. Xtra pts from clicker Qs. His objective is for you to learn NOT to give you easy questions. Best class I took so far. 3 exams, 1 opt final. Would retake the class again."
